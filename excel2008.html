<h2><a name="Toc715" id="Toc715">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (January 28, 2011), as  long as images and graphical objects are avoided, Excel 2008 for Mac provides a  set of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of  accessible digital office documents. However, Excel 2008 for Mac does not  include an accessibility checking feature. </p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Office Document&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>You  should use these techniques when you are using Excel 2008 for Mac to create documents  that are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended  to be used by people</strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images,  although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully  printable</strong>(i.e.,  where dynamic features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of  contents, etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to  other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical  of office-style workflows</strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages,  applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques  will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a><strong> because these are specifically designed to provide guidance  for highly dynamic and/or interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3><a name="Toc275959752" id="Toc275959752">File Formats</a> </h3>
<p>The  default file format for Excel 2008 for Mac is <strong>Office Open XML (XLSX)</strong>.<br />
  In  addition, Excel 2008 for Mac offers many other spreadsheet processor and web  format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility,  but some information and/or instructions are available for the following  formats in Technique 12 (below): </p>
<ul>
<li>XLS (MS Excel 97 &ndash; 2004)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate  these techniques so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether  they use a mouse. However, for clarity there are several instances where mouse-only  language is used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard  alternatives:<br />
    <strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the  Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard  have this to the right of the spacebar) or Shift+F10.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these  techniques will increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not  guarantee accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>.  In cases where more certainty  is required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end  users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p> The  application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were created using  Microsoft Excel 2008 for Mac (ver. 12.0 (071130), Mac OS X, Jan. 2011) while  creating a XLSX document.  Files are also  easily saved as other file formats (see Technique 12, below).</p>
<p>This document is provided for  information purposes only and is neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of  results. If errors are found, please report them to: <a href="mailto:adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca">adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca</a>. </p>
<h2><a name="Toc716" id="Toc716">Technique 1. Use  Accessible Templates</a> </h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template,  which can be as simple as a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly  complete document with text, graphics and other content. For example, a  &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template might include headings for information relevant to a  business meeting, such as &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and  columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point  for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a  template is accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the  template is used (See Accessibility Checking, below). </p>
<p>Excel 2008 for Mac&rsquo;s default template for new  documents is a blank page. The basic installation also includes other blank  office-related documents.  These are all  accessible by virtue of being blank. </p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible  templates from scratch in Excel 2008 for Mac.   As well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged templates,  ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4><a name="Toc278376923" id="Toc278376923">To create an  accessible template</a> </h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the  document (See Technique 10, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for  the template. Using a descriptive file name (e.g., &ldquo;Accessible Inventory Template&rdquo;) will increase the  prominence of the accessibility status. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Format</strong> list, select <strong>Excel 97 &ndash; 2004 Template (.xlt)</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Excel2008forMac_1.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Save as box and Format drop-down list in Save As dialog." width="568" height="306" /></li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="Toc278376924" id="Toc278376924">To select an  accessible template</a> </h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available (e.g.  that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt;  Project Gallery&hellip;</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Category </strong>section, select <strong>My Templates </strong>(or select where you saved  your accessible template) </li>
<li>Select your accessible template from the template gallery</li>
<li>Select <strong>Open</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Excel2008forMac_2.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of My Templates option in Category section and an accessible template in the tempkate gallery of the Project Gallery dialog." width="580" height="380" /></li>
<li>A new document  based on the template will be displayed. If you have chosen an accessible  template, the document will be accessible at this point. <strong>As you add your  content (e.g., text, images, etc.), ensure that you consult the sections that  follow to preserve accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc717" id="Toc717">Technique 2. Set  Document Language</a> </h2>
<p> At this time, it is not possible to indicate the natural language of  selected cells within an Excel 2008 for Mac workbook.  As well, it is not possible to change the  default language of an Excel 2008 for Mac workbook. [<strong>Tested: Jan 27th,  2011</strong>] <br />
In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able  to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural  language of the document.  If a different  natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to  be clearly indicated.</p>
<h2><a name="Toc718" id="Toc718">Technique 3. Provide  Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p>At this time, Excel  2008 for Mac does not offer the functionality of adding alternative text to  images or graphical objects. <strong>[Tested:  January 27, 2011]</strong> <br />
  When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is  important to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is  also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.  This can be accomplished by adding concise  alternative text to of each image. If an image is too complicated to concisely  describe in the alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a  short text alternative and a longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what       information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information,       leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text,       ensure all of the text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short,       usually a sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g.,       for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the alternative text       (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description,       see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the       document with the images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing longer  descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when       text alternatives (see above) are insufficient to answer the question       &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information       being conveyed will be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural       detail, etc.). In these cases, try to describe the image without making       too many of your own assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are       describing the image to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise       alternative text to help readers decide if they are interested in the       longer description </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<h2><a name="Toc719" id="Toc719"></a><a name="Toc278376932" id="Toc278376932">Technique 4. Format Your Cells</a> </h2>
<p>As you begin  adding content, your spreadsheet will require structuring to bring meaning to  the data, make it easier to navigate, and help assistive technologies read it  accurately.  One of the easiest ways to  do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3><a name="Toc278376933" id="Toc278376933">4.1 Named Styles</a> </h3>
<p>At this time,  Excel 2008 for Mac does not offer a Named Styles feature. <strong>[Tested: January 17, 2011]</strong> <br />
  You should make use of the named styles that  are included with the office application (e.g., &ldquo;Heading&rdquo;, &ldquo;Result&rdquo;, etc.)  before creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools  directly.  Named styles help your readers  understand why something was formatted in a given way, which is especially  helpful when there are multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is  common to use italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names).<br />
  For more information on formatting using  named styles, see Technique 9.<br />
  <em>Note:</em> While office application suites  support headings in much the same way, the named styles often differ. <br />
  Formatting  header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet and makes it easier for  users to navigate effectively.   For  example, you can format header rows and columns using &ldquo;Heading&rdquo; styles to apply  bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics).  You may also want to format cells containing  results of calculations to appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them  from the rest of your data.</p>
<h3><a name="Toc278376935" id="Toc278376935">4.2 Other Cell Characteristics</a> </h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly  represent your data, including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4><a name="Toc278376936" id="Toc278376936">To format cell characteristics</a> </h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Cells&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the relevant sections (e.g. <strong>Numbers</strong>, <strong>Alignment</strong>, etc.) make your adjustments<br />
    <em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to  avoid merging cells.  At times, it may  seem easier to present your data by merging cells, but this can make it more  difficult for users of assistive technologies and people navigating your  spreadsheet using the keyboard. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc720" id="Toc720"></a><a name="Toc278376937" id="Toc278376937">Technique 5. Use Cell  Addressing</a> </h2>
<h3><a name="Toc278376938" id="Toc278376938">5.1 Define Names</a> </h3>
<p>Naming the  different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it easier to navigate  through the document and find specific information.  By associating a meaningful name to a data  range, you will be enhancing the readability of your document.  These named ranges can be referenced in  multiple locations of your document and within calculations and equations.</p>
<h4><a name="Toc278376939" id="Toc278376939">To define a name</a> </h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells you would like to name</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Name &gt; Define&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Define Name</strong> dialog, enter the name for the data range in the <strong>Names in workbook</strong> text box</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Excel2008forMac_4.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Names in Workbook text box, Add button, and OK button in Define Name dialog." width="281" height="185" /></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc721" id="Toc721"></a><a name="Toc278376940" id="Toc278376940">Technique 6. Create  Accessible Charts</a> </h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data  more understandable for some audiences.  However, it is important to  ensure that your chart is as accessible as possible to all members of your  audience.  All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the  rest of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements  within your charts.  For example, use shape and color, rather than color  alone, to convey information.  As well, some further steps should be taken  to ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give  users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the  information. </p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the data that you  want to include in the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert  &gt; Chart&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>Select your chart type from  the <strong>Charts</strong> section that opens above the document pane<br />
    <em>Note:</em> This applies a predefined Chart Layout, which can be changed at any  time simply by selecting the chart and following <strong>Steps 2 and 3</strong> above.<br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Excel2008forMac_5.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Chart Section above document pane of application window." width="533" height="351" />
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart</li>
<li>If the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong> is not open, go to menu item: <strong>View  &gt; Toolbox, Formatting Palette</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Chart Options </strong>to open the<strong> Chart Options </strong>section,  if it is not already open </li>
<li>Under <strong>Titles</strong>, select the title from the <strong>Chart  Title</strong> drop-down list or enter a  title in the text box below the drop-down list</li>
<li>Under <strong>Other options</strong>, select the <strong>Labels</strong> and <strong>Legends </strong>you would like to include from  their respective drop-down lists</li>
<li>Under <strong>Chart Data</strong>, select <strong>Data  Table with Legend Keys</strong> from the <strong>Data  Table</strong> drop-down list to include  a data table to help further support the chart<br />
    <em>Note:</em> It is  a good idea to use as many of the titles and labels as possible.<br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Excel2008forMac_6.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Titles options, Other options, and Data Table option in Chart Options and Chart Data sections of the Formatting Palette." width="273" height="594" />
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts,  use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to  facilitate legibility for users who are color blind</li>
<li>Change the default colors  to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options  to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast requirements  (see Other Considerations, below) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Toc722" id="Toc722">Technique 7. Provide Structure for Tables</a></h2>
<p>Excel 2008 for Mac includes a &ldquo;Data Table&rdquo;  feature, but this meant for analyzing data by applying preformatted formulas  within the data table.  As such, it is  not a structural feature in the same way that tables are in Word 2010. </p>
<h2> <a name="Toc723" id="Toc723">Technique 8. Use Other  Content Structuring Features</a></h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the  most common method of structuring documents, other content structuring features  should be used where appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p>In  case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given a descriptive  and meaningful title. </p>
<h4><a name="Toc278376951" id="Toc278376951">To change the title of the current document</a> </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to  menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Summary</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Title </strong>text box and enter the <strong>Title</strong><strong><br />
    </strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the properties is different than the  file name. It is also unrelated to the template name, discussed above.  <br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Excel2008forMac_7.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Summary tab and Title box." width="434" height="503" /></li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Avoid &ldquo;Floating&rdquo; Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid &quot;floating&quot;  elements (other than charts) such as floating images, objects, tables or text  boxes.<br />
  Similarly, avoid placing  drawing objects directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create a  diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert complete  graphical objects.</p>
<h2><a name="Toc724" id="Toc724">Technique 9. Make  Content Easier to See</a> </h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When  formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for       cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than       bold or light weight fonts.  If you       do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing       and easily recognized upper and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g.,       Arial, Verdana) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g.,       Times New Roman, Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in       caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character       spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can&rsquo;t users just  zoom in?</strong>Office applications do typically include  accessibility features such as the ability to magnify documents and support for  high contrast modes. However, because printing is an important aspect of many  workflows and changing font sizes directly will change documents details such  the pagination, the layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to always  format text for a reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The  visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ration of  at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black,       Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast       (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast       (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also,  always use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
In  order to determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient  contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast  Ratio Analyzer</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Toc273692193" id="Toc273692193">9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</a> </h3>
<p>Color  should not be used as the only visual means of conveying information,  indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual  element.  In order to spot where color  might be the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a  screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale converting  tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit  v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have       edited and noting the color. Instead use Excel 2008 for Mac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Track       Changes&rdquo; features to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance       (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each image with a figure number       and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Toc273696202" id="Toc273696202"></a><a name="Toc270691604" id="Toc270691604">9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</a></h3>
<p>Before you  use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain  font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by  styling &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized  text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the  techniques noted above.</p>

<h3>10.1  Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it will  be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with       short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out       abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by       using lots of whitespace and by avoiding too many different colors, fonts       and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple       pages within a document or within a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings,       etc.), it should occur consistently each time it is repeated.  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Toc273696206" id="Toc273696206">10.2 Navigational Instructions</a></h3>
<p>Provide a  general description of the spreadsheet contents and instructions on how to  navigate the data effectively.  The best  way to do this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with  this information.  It will be the first  cell accessed by assistive technologies.   If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can attach a comment  note to the cell containing navigational instructions.</p>
<h2><a name="Toc726" id="Toc726">Technique 11.  Check Accessibility</a> </h2>
<p>At  this time, Excel 2008 for Mac does not offer a mechanism to check for potential  accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.  <strong>[Tested: January 27th, 2011]</strong><br />
  In  order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document or template  (see Technique 1), then you may consider saving the file into HTML in order to  perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML  accessibility</h4>
<p>Another  option is to save the document into HTML format and use one of the web  accessibility checkers available online.   Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM  Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Toc727" id="Toc727">Technique 12.  Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to Other Formats</a> </h2>
<p>In  some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure accessibility  information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats other than the  default.</p>
<p> Note:  Before saving in other formats, you may want to run the <strong>Compatibility Report </strong>feature  by selecting <strong>Compatibility  Report&hellip;</strong> from the <strong>Save As</strong> dialog.  This checks the compatibility of  your existing document with the format you have selected save your document  as.  The results of this check are  revealed in the <strong>Compatibility  Report</strong> dialog, where you have  explanations of errors and options to fix them.   To run this check at any time, go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox, Compatibility Report</strong>.</p>
<h3>XLS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format</strong> drop-down list, select <strong>Excel  97 &ndash; 2004 Workbook (.xls)</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save as Web Page&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong> </li>
<li>Check the HTML file for  accessibility (see Technique 11, above)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary  styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id,  class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the  &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt;  tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags  nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt; tags</li>
<li>Check for  accessibility (see Technique 11, above)<br />
  <em>Note:</em> you  may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help with this process.</li>
