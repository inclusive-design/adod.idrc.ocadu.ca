<h2><a name="Toc2211" id="Toc2211">Technique 1. Use  Accessible Templates</a> </h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template,  which can be as simple as a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly  complete document with text, graphics and other content. For example, a  &quot;Meeting Minutes&quot; template might include headings for information relevant to a  business meeting, such as &quot;Actions&quot; above a table with rows to denote time and  columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point  for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a  template is accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the  template is used (See Accessibility Checking, below). </p>
<p>Word 2007&rsquo;s default template for new documents  is a blank page. The basic installation also includes blank business card, blank  label templates, and other blank office-related documents.  These are all accessible by virtue of being  blank. </p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible  templates from scratch in Word 2007.  As  well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged templates, ensuring  their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible  template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document  (from the default blank template or from one of the prepackaged templates)</li>
<li>Ensure that you  follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished  you should also check the accessibility of the document (See Technique 10,  below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Word Template</strong> </li>
<li>Save the template in  the <strong>Microsoft  &gt; Templates</strong> folder</li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the template.  Using  a descriptive <strong>File  name</strong> (e.g., &quot;Accessible Memo  Template&quot;) may increase the prominence of the accessibility status.  As well, filling in the text box labeled <strong>Tags</strong> with the term &quot;accessibility&quot; may improve its  searchability as an accessible file. </li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Word2007_1.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of File name, Save as type and Tags text boxes in the Save As dialog." width="736" height="506" /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible  template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available (e.g.  that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; New</strong> </li>
<li>Under <strong>Templates</strong>,  select <strong>My  templates&hellip;</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Word2007_2.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Templates section and My templates option in New Document dialog." width="909" height="444" /></li>
<li>In the <strong>New</strong> document dialog, select your accessible template from the list in the <strong>My Templates</strong> tab <br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Word2007_3.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of My Templates tab and templates list in the New dialog." width="453" height="283" /></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have chosen  an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text,  images, etc.), ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve  accessibility.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2><a name="Toc2212" id="Toc2212">Technique 2. Specify  Document Language</a> </h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able  to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural  language of the document.  If a different  natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to  be clearly indicated.</p>
<h4>To change the default  language</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the operating system, activate the keyboard layout for the language  in which you want to create and edit text</li>
<li>Right-click* the status bar at the bottom of the window, ensure that <strong>Language</strong> is selected, this displays a reminder of the active keyboard layout in the  status bar<br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Word2007_4.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of active keyboard reminder in the status bar of the application window." width="496" height="322" /></li>
</ol>
<p> Word 2007 has an automatic language detection mechanism, which can  automatically detect the language of your text.   If you type a section of text in a different language than the rest of  your document, Word 2007 will programmatically mark the language of that  section of text appropriately.  <strong></strong></p>
<h4>To turn on automatic  language detection</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Proofing</strong> section, select the <strong>Set Language</strong> button</li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Detect language automatically</strong> check box <br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Word2007_5.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of the Detect language automatically check box in the Language dialog." width="389" height="348" /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language  directly to selected text </h4>
<ol>
<li>Select  the text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Proofing</strong> section, select the <strong>Set Language</strong> button </li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as </strong>box,  select the language from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Word2007_6.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of the Mark selected text as language list in the Language dialog." width="389" height="348" /><br />

<h2><a name="Toc2213" id="Toc2213">Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p>When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is  important to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is  also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.  This can be accomplished by adding concise  alternative text to of each image. If an image is too complicated to concisely  describe in the alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a  short text alternative and a longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above) are insufficient to answer the question &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help readers decide if they are interested in the longer description </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<h4>To add alternative text to images  and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click*  the object </li>
<li>Select <strong>Size&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>Select  the <strong>Alt  Text</strong> tab in the <strong>Size</strong> dialog </li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Alternative Text</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong> <br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Word2007_7.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Alt Text tab, Alternative text box, and Close button in the Size dialog." width="417" height="467" /></li>
</ol>
<p>
     When inserting a very small  image, or resizing a larger image to be much smaller, Word 2007 assumes that  the image is intended to be a bullet-point for a bulleted list.  Once Word 2007 defines the image as a bullet,  the option to add alternative text disappears. Select <strong>Undo</strong>, to redefine the bullet as an  image.  When you right-click* the image,  select <strong>Format Picture&hellip;</strong> and select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> tab in the <strong>Format Picture</strong> dialog.  Alternative text can be found, or can be  entered, into the <strong>Alternative text</strong> box.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="Toc2214" id="Toc2214">Technique  4. Avoid &quot;Floating&quot; Elements</a></h2>
<p>When  images and objects are inserted into Word 2007 documents they default to being  an &quot;inline object&quot;.  Inline objects keep  their position on the page relative to a portion of the text.  A  &quot;floating&quot; object keeps its position relative to the page, while text flows  around it.  As content moves up or down on  the page, the object stays where it was placed.   To ensure that images and objects remain with the text that references  it, always position it as an inline object.</p>
<p> Similarly, avoid placing  drawing objects directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create a  diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert complete  graphical objects.</p>
<h4>To prevent an image or  object from &quot;floating&quot;</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select  the object </li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Page  Layout</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Position</strong> from the <strong>Arrange</strong> section </li>
<li>Select <strong>In Line with  Text</strong> </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2><a name="Toc2215" id="Toc2215">Technique 5. Use  Headings</a> </h2>
<p>Any  documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require structuring to make  them more straightforward for readers to understand. <strong>One of the easiest ways to do this is  to use &quot;True Headings&quot; to </strong>create logical  divisions between paragraphs. True headings are more than just bolded, enlarged, or centered text; they are structural elements that order and levels  provide a meaningful sequence to users of assistive technologies.</p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<h3>Tips for headings</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use the default headings styles provided (&quot;Heading &quot;, &quot;Heading 2&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the sub-headings of a &quot;Heading 1&quot; are &quot;Heading 2&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>To apply headings using the  Styles toolbar</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong><strong></strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the heading you wish to apply<br />
    <em>Note:</em> You can scroll through the multiple heading styles using the arrows on the  right side of the <strong>Styles</strong> section.  You can also change the <strong>Style</strong> design by selecting the <strong>Change  Styles</strong> button on the right.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, right-click* the style you wish to use from the <strong>Styles Gallery</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Modify  Style</strong> dialog, make the appropriate changes to style characteristics </li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h4>To return to the default heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select <strong>Change  Styles</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Style Set</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Word 2007</strong> from the list</li>
</ol>
<!-- <h2><a name="Toc2216" id="Toc2216">Technique 6. Use Named Styles</a></h2>
<p>As with &quot;True Headings&quot; (see  Technique 5), you should attempt to make use of the named styles that are  included with the office application (e.g., &quot;emphasis&quot;, &quot;caption&quot;, etc.) before  creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly.  Named styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a given  way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons for the same  formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis, Latin terms and  species names). For more information on  formatting using named styles, see Technique 9.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in much the same  way, the named styles often differ. </p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>

<h2><a name="Toc2217" id="Toc2217">Technique 6. Use Built-In Document Structuring Features</a></h2>
<h3>6.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is  important to ensure that they are clear and appropriately structured. This  helps all users to better understand the information in the table and allows  assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to provide context so that the  information within the table can be conveyed in a meaningful way. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<h3>Tips for tables</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as to position columns.</li>
<li>Use &quot;real tables&quot; rather than text formatted to look like tables using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible. Whenever possible, use just one row of headings.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text  summary of the essential table contents. Any abbreviations used should be  explained in the summary. </li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question &quot;what is the  table's purpose and how is it organized?&quot; (e.g., &quot;A sample order form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity&quot;).  </li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as labels to help interpret the other cells in the table. </li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear. </li>
<li>Ensure the table is not &quot;floating&quot; on the page (see Technique 4). </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>To add a table with  headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Tables</strong> section, select the <strong>Tables</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the number of rows and  columns you would like your table to have</li>
<li>Select the table and a <strong>Table Tools</strong> menu item should appear</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table Tools &gt; Design</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Table Style Options</strong> section, select the <strong>Header Row</strong> check box
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>6.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When  you create lists, it is important to format them as &quot;real lists&quot;. Otherwise,  assistive technologies will interpret your list as a series of short separate  paragraphs instead of a coherent list of related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the <strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the <strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists</li>
<li>To choose a different  list format, select the arrow beside the icon</li>
<li>Select a format from  the format <strong>Library</strong> that appears in the drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the arrow beside  the <strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or  select the arrow beside the <strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Bullet&hellip;</strong> to create a new unordered list  format</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Number Format&hellip;</strong> to create a new ordered list  format</li>
<li>In the <strong>New Bullet</strong> dialog or the <strong>New Number Format</strong> dialog, select the list  characteristics</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h3>6.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text  in columns. However, because columns can be a challenge for users of some  assistive technologies, you should consider whether a column layout is really  necessary.</p>
<h3>6.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a  page break instead of repeated hard returns.</p>
<h3>6.5 Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating  an index or table of contents to outline office document content can provide a  means of navigating the meaningful sequence of content.  </p>
<p> The best way to generate a table  of contents is after applying the predefined heading styles, such as  &quot;Heading 1&quot; as described above, to the headings that you want to  include in your table of contents. After you apply these styles, you can then  create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To insert a table of contents </h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in your document  where you want to create the table of contents </li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>References</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section, select <strong>Table of Contents</strong> </li>
<li>Select the style that you want to  use </li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a table of contents </h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the table</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>References</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section, select the <strong>Update  Table</strong> button<strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc275959790" id="_Toc275959790">6.6 Use Page Numbering</a></h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of your  document helps those reading and editing your document effectively navigate and  reference its content.  For users of  assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference within the  document.</p>
<h4>To  insert page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Header &amp; Footer</strong> section,  select <strong>Page Number</strong></li>
<li>Select where you  would like to insert your page numbers</li>
<li>Select the style  of page number you would like to use</li>
</ol>
<h4>To format page  numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong><strong></strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Header &amp; Footer</strong> section,  select <strong>Page Number</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Page Numbers&hellip;</strong><strong></strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Page Number Format</strong> dialog, select  the page format characteristics you would like to use<br />
    <em>Note:</em> These changes are applied to the predefined page format  styles.  It does not create a new page  format style.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>In  case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given a descriptive  and meaningful title. </p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Prepare &gt; Properties</strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Document  Properties</strong> section that appears, select the <strong>Title</strong> text box </li>
<li>Enter  the <strong>Title</strong><strong><br />
  </strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated  to the template name, discussed above. </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2><a name="Toc2218" id="Toc2218"></a>Technique 7. Create Accessible Charts </h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some audiences.  However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as possible to all members of your audience. </p>
<ul>
<li>All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts.  For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey information.
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather than colors to differentiate the bars</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the information.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see Technique 9.2)</li>
<li>Consider providing the data that you used to create the chart in tabular form (e.g. as an appendix).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><a name="Toc2219" id="Toc2219">Technique 8. Make  Content Easier to See</a> </h2>
<p>Here  are some other things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3>8.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When  formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.  If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can&rsquo;t users just  zoom in?</strong>Office applications do typically include  accessibility features such as the ability to magnify documents and support for  high contrast modes. However, because printing is an important aspect of many  workflows and changing font sizes directly will change documents details such  the pagination, the layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to always  format text for a reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong><strong></strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, right-click* the <strong>Style</strong> you wish to modify</li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify Style</strong> </li>
<li>Under <strong>Formatting</strong> in the <strong>Modify</strong> dialog box, select the  appropriate font size</li>
<li>Exit with <strong>OK</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/MSWord2010_8.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Formatting options in the Modify Style dialog." width="526" height="532" /></li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The  visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ration of  at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also,  always use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
  In  order to determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient  contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast Ratio  Analyzer</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>8.3 Avoid Using  Color Alone </h3>
<p>Color  should not be used as the only visual means of conveying information,  indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual  element.  In order to spot where color  might be the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a screenshot  of the document and then view it with online gray-scale converting tools, such  as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit  v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>8.4 Avoid Relying on  Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have edited and noting the color. Instead use Word 2007&rsquo;s &quot;Track Changes&quot; feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance (e.g. &quot;the bigger one&quot;). Instead, label each image with a figure number and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.5 Avoid Using Images of  Text</h3>
<p>Before  you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain  font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by  styling &quot;real text&quot;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized  text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the  techniques noted above.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="Toc2220" id="Toc2220">Technique 9. Make Content Easier to  Understand</a></h2>
<h3>9.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in  a consistent way, it will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all  users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too &quot;busy&quot; by using lots of whitespace and by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur consistently each time it is repeated.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks  are more effective navigation aids when the user understands the likely result  of following the link. Otherwise, users may have to use trial-and-error to find  what they need.</p>
<p> To  help the user understand the result of selecting a hyperlink, ensure that the link  makes sense when read in the context of the text around it. For example, while  it would be confusing to use &quot;more information&quot; as a link by itself on a page,  it would be fine to use &quot;more information&quot; as a link in the following sentence:  &quot;The airport can be reached by taxi or bus (<u>more information</u>).&quot;</p>
<p>To  make the address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the  address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with  meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Type (or paste in) a web address  and press spacebar or &quot;Enter&quot; to convert into a hyperlink</li>
<li>Select the link and right-click*</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit Hyperlink</strong> (Ctrl + K)</li>
<li>Edit the text in the <strong>Text to display</strong> box </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Toc2221" id="Toc2221">Technique 10. Check  Accessibility</a> </h2>
<p>At  this time, Word 2007 does not offer a mechanism to check for potential  accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.  <strong>[Tested: January 10th, 2011]</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="Toc2222" id="Toc2222">Technique 11. Use  Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to Other Formats</a> </h2>
<p>In  some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure accessibility  information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats other than the  default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p><strong></strong>PDF documents are not always accessible.  Accessible PDF documents are often called &quot;Tagged PDF&quot; because they include  &quot;tags&quot; that encode structural information required for accessibility.  To evaluate the accessibility of your PDF  document, see Technique 11 (above).</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the file is saved as a DOCX (Older DOC files are not compatible with the checker).
</li><li>Go to menu item:<strong> Office &gt; Save As &gt; PDF or XPS</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name </strong>box,  type a name for the file</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> button</li>
<li>Under <strong>Include non-printing information</strong>,  ensure that the <strong>Document  structure tags for accessibility</strong> check box is  selected</li>
<li>Under <strong>PDF options</strong>,  ensure that <strong>Bitmap  text when fonts may not be embedded</strong> check box is de-selected</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Save</strong><br />

</ol>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Other Formats</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select <strong>Web  Page</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong> </li>
<li>Check the HTML file for accessibility (see Technique 10, above)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove  unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove  unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove  font tags</li>
<li>Remove  styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure  the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove  &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt; tags</li>
<li>Check  for accessibility (see Technique 10, above)<br />
  <em>Note:</em> you  may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help with this process.</li>

<h2><a name="Toc2210" id="Toc2210">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (January 10, 2011),  Word 2007 provides a set of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable  the production of accessible digital office documents. However, Word 2007 does  not include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<p>This guide is intended to be used for documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended  to be used by people</strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images,  although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully  printable</strong>(i.e.,  where dynamic features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of  contents, etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to  other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical  of office-style workflows</strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages,  applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques  will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility  Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a><strong> because these are specifically designed to provide guidance  for highly dynamic and/or interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats </h3>
<p>The  default file format for Word 2007 is <strong>Office Open XML (DOCX)</strong>.<br />
In  addition, Word 2007 offers many other word processor and web format saving  options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility.</p>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate  these techniques so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether  they use a mouse. However, for clarity there are several instances where  mouse-only language is used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard  alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the  Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the &quot;Right-Click&quot; key (some keyboard  have this to the right of the spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these  techniques will increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not  guarantee accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>.  In cases where more  certainty is required, it is recommended that you test the office documents  with end users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The  application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were created using  Microsoft Word 2007 (ver.12.0.6545.5000, Windows 7, Jan. 2011) while creating a  DOCX document.  Files are also easily  saved as other file formats (see Technique 11, below).</li>
