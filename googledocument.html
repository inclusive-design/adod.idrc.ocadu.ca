<h2><a name="_Toc284510350" id="_Toc284510350">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (August  20, 2010), Google docs: Document lacks several features that enable accessible  office document authoring, most notably: the ability to add alternative text to  images, &quot;true headings&quot;, and table headings. As a result, some of the  other features that might otherwise support accessibility, such as its  extensive templates are not as effective. In addition, Google docs: Document  does not include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Office Document&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>You  should use these techniques when you are using Google docs: Document to create documents  that are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended  to be used by people</strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images,  although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully  printable</strong>(i.e., where  dynamic features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents,  etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to  other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical  of office-style workflows</strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating  forms, web pages, applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content,  these techniques will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a><strong> because these are specifically designed to provide guidance  for highly dynamic and/or interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc275959752" id="_Toc275959752">File Formats</a> </h3>
<p>Google docs: Document does not  have a default file format as it is a web-based authoring tool.</p>
<p>Google  docs: Document offers a number of word processor and web format saving options.  Most of these have not been checked for accessibility, but some information  and/or instructions are available for the following formats in <a href="googledocument.html#_Toc284342222">Technique 12</a> :</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Word </li>
<li>PDF </li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate  these techniques so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether  they use a mouse. However, for clarity there are several instances where  mouse-only language is used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard  alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the  Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard  have this to the right of the spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these  techniques will increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not  guarantee accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more  certainty is required, it is recommended that you test the office documents  with end users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The  application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were created using Google docs: Document (ver.30 09  2010, Internet Explorer ver.7.0.6001/Windows XP, Aug. 2010). Files  are easily saved as various file formats (see <a href="googledocument.html#_Toc284342222">Technique 12</a>).<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284510351" id="_Toc284510351">Technique 1. Use  Accessible Templates</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>At this time, Google  Doc&rsquo;s extensive collection of templates should be treated cautiously. The fact  that the Google docs: Document editor lacks support for accessibility features  such as alternative text, &ldquo;true headings&rdquo;, and table headings also means that  the templates created with the editor are also lacking in these areas. <strong>[Tested: August 20, 2010]</strong><br />
  All office documents start with a template,  which can be as simple as a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly  complete document with text, graphics and other content. For example, a  &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template might include headings for information relevant to a  business meeting, such as &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and  columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point  for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a  template is accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the  template is used (see <a href="googledocument.html#_Toc284342221">Technique 11</a>). </p>
<p>Google docs:  Document&rsquo;s default template for new documents is a blank page. The basic  installation also includes a wide variety of templates ranging from blank  business letters and memos to blank business cards and schedules. These are all accessible by virtue of being  blank.</p>
<p>It is possible  to create your own templates from scratch in Google docs: Document. As well, you can edit and modify the existing  templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new  template.</p>
<h4><a name="_Toc273694152" id="_Toc273694152">To select a template</a></h4>

<h2><a name="_Toc284510352" id="_Toc284510352">Technique 2. Specify  Document Language</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong>At  this time, Google docs: Document does not offer an explicit language selection  mechanism to indicate the natural language of your document or changes in  natural language at any point within the content. Google docs: Document defaults the natural  language to the language selected for your Google Account. When exporting to other document formats,  there is no guarantee that the natural language of your Google Account will be  indicated as the natural language of your document. [<strong>Tested: August  20, 2010]</strong> </p>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able  to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural  language of the document. If a different  natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to  be clearly indicated.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284510353" id="_Toc284510353">Technique 3. Provide  Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs: Document does not  offer a mechanism for adding alternative text or longer descriptions to images  and objects where it can be readily accessed by screen reader users. As a result, you will need to ensure that you  provide the alternate text and/or longer descriptions in the body of the  document, near the images and objects. While this solution is not optimal for  screen reader users and will complicate your own accessibility testing, it is  necessary under alternative text and descriptions are supported. <strong>[Tested: August 20, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is  important to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is  also conveyed to people who cannot see the image. This can be accomplished by adding concise  alternative text to of each image. If an image is too complicated to concisely  describe in the alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a  short text alternative and a longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what       information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful       information, leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text,       ensure all of the text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short,       usually a sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g.,       for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the alternative text       (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description,       see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the document       with the images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing longer  descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when       text alternatives (see above) are insufficient to answer the question       &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information       being conveyed will be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural       detail, etc.). In these cases, try to describe the image without making       too many of your own assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are       describing the image to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise       alternative text to help readers decide if they are interested in the       longer description </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of the  document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case, you  do not have to provide alternate text within the image.<br />
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/GoogleDocsDocument10.png" alt="Image demonstrates inserted image options, which does not include an option for alternative text." width="445" height="173" /></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284510354" id="_Toc284510354">Technique  4. Avoid &ldquo;Floating&rdquo; Elements</a></h2>
<p>When images and objects are inserted into  Google docs: Document they default to being positioned &ldquo;inline&rdquo; with the text. There is also the option to attach images and  objects to a fixed position on the page. </p>
<p>A &ldquo;floating&rdquo; object keeps its position  relative to the page, while text flows around it. As content moves up or down on the page, the  object stays where it was placed. To  ensure that images and objects remain with the text that references it, always  position it as &ldquo;inline&rdquo; with the text at the end of the in-text reference.</p>
<p>Similarly, avoid placing  drawing objects directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create a  diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert complete  graphical objects.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284510355" id="_Toc284510355">Technique 5. Use  Headings</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>At this time, Google  docs: Document does not support &ldquo;true headings&rdquo;. The heading levels displayed  in Google docs: Document are styles, with no semantic grounding. When the  documents are downloaded as ODT or HTML, the heading capabilities of these  formats is not employed. As well, it is  not possible to modify heading styles. <strong>[Tested: August 20, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>Any  documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require structuring to make  them more straightforward for readers to understand. <strong>One of the easiest ways to do this is  to use &ldquo;True Headings&rdquo; to </strong>create logical  divisions between paragraphs. True headings are more than just bolded,  enlarged, or centered text; they are structural elements that order and levels  provide a meaningful sequence to users of assistive technologies.</p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for headings</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use the default headings styles provided       (&ldquo;Heading &ldquo;, &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo;, etc.)</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the       sub-headings of a &ldquo;Heading 1&rdquo; are &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo;, etc.)</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>Although Google docs: Document headings  are <strong><u>not</u></strong> &ldquo;true headings&rdquo; they are still  recommended for accessibility because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They will still be  useful to users who benefit from the visual formatting but who do not make use  of &ldquo;header navigation&rdquo; features,</li>
<li>They are necessary if  the Table of Contents feature is to be used, and</li>
<li>Since Google docs:  Document is a Web Application, a future update may resolve the issue. </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="_Toc273694163" id="_Toc273694163">To apply headings from the Format menu</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight  the text that you want to make into a navigational heading </li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Paragraph Styles</strong></li>
<li>Select  the desired heading you would like to apply to the text </li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="_Toc273694164" id="_Toc273694164">To apply headings using the Heading  drop-down menu</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text  that you want to make into a navigational heading</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Heading</strong> drop-down menu from the standard bar (next to the <strong>Font</strong> drop-down menu)</li>
<li>Select the desired  heading you would like to apply to the text</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="_Toc273694165" id="_Toc273694165">To apply headings using keyboard shortcuts</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text  that you want to make into a navigational heading</li>
<li>Select Ctrl+Alt+1 (for Heading  1),Ctrl+Alt+2 (for Heading 2), etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284510356" id="_Toc284510356">Technique 6. Use Named Styles</a></h2>
<p>As with &ldquo;True Headings&rdquo; (see  <a href="googledocument.html#_Toc284510355">Technique 5</a>), you should attempt to make use of the named styles that are  included with the office application (e.g., &ldquo;emphasis&rdquo;, &ldquo;caption&rdquo;, etc.) before  creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly.  Named styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a  given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons for the  same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis, Latin terms  and species names).</p>
<p>For more information on  formatting using named styles, see <a href="googledocument.html#_Toc284510359">Technique 9</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in much the same  way, the named styles often differ. </p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Default named styles can be applied the       same way as headings (see <a href="googledocument.html#_Toc284510355">Technique 5</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h2> <a name="_Toc284510357" id="_Toc284510357">Technique </a>7. Use Built-In Document  Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs: Document does not  offer a mechanism that allows you to select and indicate headings for rows and  columns. <strong>[Tested:  August 20, 2010]</strong> </p>
<p>When using tables, it is  important to ensure that they are clear and appropriately structured. This  helps all users to better understand the information in the table and allows  assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to provide context so that the  information within the table can be conveyed in a meaningful way. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information,       not for formatting, such as to position columns.</li>
<li>Use &ldquo;real tables&rdquo; rather than text       formatted to look like tables using the TAB key or space bar. These will       not be recognized by assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged       cells and dividing complex data sets into separate smaller tables, where       possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the       header to show at the top of each page. Also set the table to break       between rows instead of in the middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text  summary of the essential table contents. Any abbreviations used should be  explained in the summary. </li>
<li>Table       captions or descriptions should answer the question &quot;what is the       table's purpose and how is it organized?&quot; (e.g., &quot;A sample order       form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity&quot;). </li>
<li>Table       cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as labels to help       interpret the other cells in the table. </li>
<li>Table       header cell labels should be concise and clear. </li>
<li>Ensure       the table is not &ldquo;floating&rdquo; on the page (see <a href="googledocument.html#_Toc284510354">Technique 4</a>) </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
</p><p>When  you create lists, it is important to format them as &ldquo;real lists&rdquo;. Otherwise,  assistive technologies will interpret your list as a series of short separate  paragraphs instead of a coherent list of related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or  unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; List styles</strong></li>
<li>Select<strong> </strong>the list style you want to use </li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text  in columns. <br />
    <em>Note:</em> Because  columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive technologies, consider  whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a  page break instead of repeated hard returns.</p>
<h3>7.5 Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating  an index or table of contents to outline office document content can provide a  means of navigating the meaningful sequence of content. </p>
<p>The best way to generate a table  of contents is after applying the predefined heading styles, such as  &quot;Heading&nbsp;1&quot; as described above, to the headings that you want to  include in your table of contents. After you apply these styles, you can then  create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To insert a Table of  Contents</h4>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Position cursor where you would like to       place the table within your document</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table of       contents</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a Table of  Contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click within the table</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Update now</strong> button</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc275959790" id="_Toc275959790">7.6 Use Page Numbering</a></h3>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs: Document does not  include a page numbering feature. <strong>[Tested:  August 20, 2010]</strong> </p>
<p>Numbering the pages of your  document helps those reading and editing your document effectively navigate and  reference its content. For users of  assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference within the  document.</p>
<h3>7.7 Document Title</h3>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs: Document makes use  of a single document name. Within Google docs, this serves well as a title, but  when exporting to ODT, the document name is used to form the file name and the  ODT &ldquo;Title&rdquo; properties field is left blank. <strong>[Tested: August  20, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>In  case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given a descriptive  and meaningful title. </p>
<h4>To  change the file name of the current document</h4>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Rename</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Rename Document</strong> dialog,       enter a new document name </li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc278376940" id="_Toc278376940">Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs:  Document does not offer an option to insert data charts. <strong>[Tested: February 4, 2011]</strong><br />
  Charts  can be used to make data more understandable for some audiences. However,  it is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as possible to all  members of your audience. All basic  accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must  also be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts. For  example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey  information. As well, some further steps should be taken to ensure that  the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users reference  points that will help them to correctly interpret the information. </p>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts,  use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to  facilitate legibility for users who are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it  is helpful to apply textures rather than color to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors  to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options  to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast  requirements (see <a href="googledocument.html#tech9.2">Technique 9.2</a>) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc284510359" id="_Toc284510359">Technique 9. Make  Content Easier to See</a> </h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>At this time, it is not possible to change  the text size for a default named style. <strong>[Tested:  September 20th, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>When  formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for       body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than       bold or light weight fonts. If you       do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing       and easily recognized upper and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts       (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts       (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in       caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character       spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can&rsquo;t users just  zoom in?</strong>Office applications do typically include  accessibility features such as the ability to magnify documents and support for  high contrast modes.</p>
<p>However, because printing is an important aspect of many  workflows and changing font sizes directly will change documents details such  the pagination, the layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to always  format text for a reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><a name="tech9.2" id="tech9.2"></a>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The  visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ration of  at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black,       Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast       (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast       (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also,  always use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
  In  order to determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient  contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast  Ratio Analyzer</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using  Color Alone </h3>
<p>Color  should not be used as the only visual means of conveying information,  indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual  element. In order to spot where color  might be the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a  screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale converting  tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit  v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on  Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing       the color of text you have edited and noting the color. &nbsp;Instead use Google docs: Document&rsquo;s       review functionality features to track changes, such as the revision       history and TextFlow mechanisms. </li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by       referring to their appearance (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each       image with a figure number and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of  Text</h3>
<p>Before  you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain  font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by  styling &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized  text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the  techniques noted in <a href="googledocument.html#_Toc284510353">Technique 3</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284510360" id="_Toc284510360">Technique 10.  Make Content Easier to Understand</a> </h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in  a consistent way, it will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all  users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever possible, write       clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and       spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too       &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by using lots of whitespace and by avoiding too many different       colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on       multiple pages within a document or within a set of documents (e.g.,       headings, footings, etc.), it should occur consistently each time it is       repeated. </li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks  are more effective navigation aids when the user understands the likely result  of following the link. Otherwise, users may have to use trial-and-error to find  what they need.</p>
<p>To  help the user understand the result of selecting a hyperlink, ensure that the  link makes sense when read in the context of the text around it. For example,  while it would be confusing to use &ldquo;more information&rdquo; as a link by itself on a  page, it would be fine to use &ldquo;more information&rdquo; as a link in the following  sentence: &ldquo;The airport can be reached by taxi or bus (<u>more information</u>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  make the address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the  address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Link&hellip; </strong>(Ctrl+K)</li>
<li>In the <strong>Edit Link </strong>dialog, enter  descriptive text in the <strong>Text to </strong>display  box</li>
<li>Enter the link address in the <strong>To what URL should this link go? </strong>Box<br />
  <em>Note:</em> To link to a bookmark within the  document, enable the <strong>Bookmark </strong>option  by clicking <strong>Bookmark</strong> within the <strong>Link to </strong>section.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK

<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM  Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If  you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the following tools  and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Acrobat  Professional</li>
<li><a href="http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pac-pdf-accessibility-checker.html">PDF Accessibility Checker (PAC)</a> &ndash;  a free alternative provided by &ldquo;Access for all&rdquo; </li>
