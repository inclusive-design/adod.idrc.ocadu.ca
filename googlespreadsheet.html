<h2><a name="_Toc284929148" id="_Toc284929148">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (September 20, 2010),  Google docs: Spreadsheet lacks several features that enable accessible office  document authoring, most notably: the ability to add alternative text to images  and objects, the ability to indicate changes in natural language, programmatically  determined named styles, the ability to anchor floating images and objects, and  a separate document title field. As a  result, some of the other features that might otherwise support accessibility,  such as its extensive templates are not as effective. In addition, Google docs:  Spreadsheet does not include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Office Document&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>You should use  these techniques when you are using Google docs: Spreadsheet to create  documents that are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people </strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based </strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable </strong>(i.e., where dynamic features are limited to  automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not include audio,  video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained </strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows </strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations,  etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages,  applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques  will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the  </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) </strong></a><strong> because these are specifically  designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or interactive content. </strong></p>
<h3>File  Formats</h3>
<p>Google docs:  Spreadsheet does not have a default file format, as it is a web-based authoring  tool. </p>
<p>Google docs:  Spreadsheet offers various spreadsheet processor and web format saving options.  Most of these have not been checked for accessibility, but some information  and/or instructions are available for the following formats in <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc284929160">Technique 12</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>MS Excel</li>
<li>PDF </li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document  Conventions </h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques  so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse.  However, for clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is  used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the  keyboard, select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either  (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard have this to the right of the  spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer  and Testing Details: </h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will  increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not guarantee  accessibility to any specific disability groups </strong>. In cases where more certainty is required, it  is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with  disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The application-specific steps  and screenshots in this document were created using Google docs: Spreadsheet  (ver.30 09 2010, Internet Explorer ver.7.0.6001/Windows XP, Sept. 2010) while producing files in  proprietary format. Files are also  easily saved as other file formats (see <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc284929160">Technique 12</a>). </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284929149" id="_Toc284929149">Technique  1. Use Accessible Templates</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong>At this time,  Google doc&rsquo;s extensive collection of templates should be treated cautiously.  The fact that the Google docs: Spreadsheet editor lacks support for  accessibility features such as alternative text and named styles also means  that the templates created with the editor are also lacking in these areas. <strong>[Tested: August 20, 2010] </strong> </p>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as a  blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document with  text, graphics and other content. For example, a &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template  might include headings for information relevant to a business meeting, such as  &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and columns for actions of the  meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,  accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is accessible,  you should check a sample document produced when the template is used (see  <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc282436952">Technique 11</a>). </p>
<p>Google docs: Spreadsheet&rsquo;s default template for new documents is a blank  spreadsheet.  The basic  installation also includes a wide variety of templates ranging from blank  service invoices to blank project management schedules. These are all accessible by virtue of being  blank.</p>
<p>It is  possible to create your own templates from scratch in Google docs: Spreadsheet. As well, you can edit and modify the existing  templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new  template.</p>
<h4>To select a template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to  menu item: <strong>Create New &gt; From Template

<h2><a name="_Toc284929150" id="_Toc284929150">Technique  2. Set Document Language</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong>At  this time, Google docs: Spreadsheet does not offer an explicit language  selection mechanism to indicate the natural language of your spreadsheet or  changes in natural language at any point within the content (e.g. a few cells  containing text in a different language than the rest of the spreadsheet). Google docs: Spreadsheet defaults the natural  language to the language selected for your Google Account. When exporting to other document formats,  there is no guarantee that the natural language of your Google Account will be  indicated as the natural language of your document. <strong>[Tested: September 20th, 2010] </strong></p>
<p>In order  for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able to present your  document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural language of the  document. If a different natural  language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be  clearly indicated.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284929151" id="_Toc284929151">Technique  3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs: Spreadsheet does  not offer a mechanism for adding alternative text or longer descriptions to  images and objects where it can be readily accessed by screen reader users. As a result, you will need to ensure that you  provide the alternative text and/or longer descriptions in the body of the  document, near the images and objects. While this solution is not optimal for  screen reader users and will complicate your own accessibility testing, it is  necessary under alternative text and descriptions are supported.<strong> [Tested: August 20, 2010]  </strong></p>
<p>When using  images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is important  to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is also  conveyed to people who cannot see the image.  This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to each  image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the alternative  text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text alternative and a  longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for  writing alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what information is the       image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information,       leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the       text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a       sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or       graph), provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a       summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the       images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for  writing longer descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives       (see above) are insufficient to answer the question &quot;what information       is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will       be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In       these cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own       assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image       to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text       to help readers decide if they are interested in the longer description </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284929152" id="_Toc284929152">Technique  4. Format Your Cells</a> </h2>
<p>As you begin  adding content, your spreadsheet will require structuring to bring meaning to  the data, make it easier to navigate, and help assistive technologies read it  accurately. One of the easiest ways to  do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc278376933" id="_Toc278376933">4.1 Named Styles</a></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs: Spreadsheet does not offer named styles  functionality. <strong>[Tested: September 21, 2010]  </strong></p>
<p>You should make use of the named styles that  are included with the office application (e.g., &ldquo;Heading&rdquo;, &ldquo;Result&rdquo;, etc.)  before creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools  directly. Named styles help your readers  understand why something was formatted in a given way, which is especially  helpful when there are multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is  common to use italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p>For more information on formatting using  named styles, see <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc284929157">Technique 9</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application  suites support headings in much the same way, the named styles often differ. </p>
<p>Formatting  header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet and makes it easier for  users to navigate effectively.  For  example, you can format header rows and columns using &ldquo;Heading&rdquo; styles to apply  bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics). You may also want to format cells containing  results of calculations to appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them  from the rest of your data.</p>
<h3>4.2 Other Cell Characteristics   </h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly  represent your data, including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell  characteristics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight  the cells that you want to format<br />
    <em>Note:</em> to format a row or column, select the row or column indicator and  follow the next steps</li>
<li>Go  to the menu icon bar</li>
<li>Select  the icon or drop-down list for the format you would like to apply (e.g. <strong>Format as currency </strong>, <strong>Format as percent </strong>, <strong>More formats </strong>)<br />
  <em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to  avoid merging cells. At times, it may  seem easier to present your data by merging cells, but this can make it more  difficult for users of assistive technologies and people navigating your  spreadsheet using the keyboard.

</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284929153" id="_Toc284929153">Technique  5. Use Cell Addressing</a> </h2>
<h3>5.1 Define Names</h3>
<p>Naming the  different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it easier to navigate  through the document and find specific information. By associating a meaningful name to a data  range, you will be enhancing the readability of your document. These named ranges can be referenced in  multiple locations of your document and within calculations and equations.</p>
<h4>To define a name</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select  the cells you would like to name</li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Edit &gt; Named ranges &gt; Define new  range&hellip; </strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Range names </strong> dialog, enter a name for the range in the <strong>Nickname </strong> text box</li>
<li>If  necessary, update the data range by clicking the <strong>Select data range </strong> button or entering the data range in the <strong>Select data range </strong> text box</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save </strong> </li>
<li>Click <strong>Done </strong>
<p>

    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc278376940" id="_Toc278376940">Technique 6.  Create Accessible Charts</a> </h2>
<p>Spreadsheet applications support various types of charts, which can be  used to display your spreadsheet data in meaningful ways for your  audience. It is important to ensure that  your chart is as accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic accessibility considerations that  are applied to the rest of your document must also be applied to your charts  and the elements within your charts. For  example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey  information. As well, some further steps  should be taken to ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate  labeled to give users reference points that will help to correctly interpret  the information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<p><strong> </strong>It will  not be possible to access the chart customization features after creating and  inserting the chart. For this reason, it  is necessary to name and label the chart at the time of creation. <strong>[Tested: December 8, 2010] </strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert  &gt; Chart </strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart  Editor </strong>, a data range has been pre-selected and will appear in the box labeled  Data. (Note: If this range is incorrect,  enter a new range in the box labeled <strong>Data </strong>. To update the data range by manually  highlighting the cells, select the <strong>Select  range&hellip; </strong> link.  This opens the <strong>What data? </strong> dialog, which allows you to highlight the data range and select <strong>OK </strong>.)</li>
<li>In the <strong>Chard  Editor </strong> dialog, select the <strong>Use  row 1 as headers </strong> check box if the first row of  your data is a header row</li>
<li>Select the chart type from the <strong>Recommended charts </strong> section</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Customize </strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart  section </strong>, enter a title for the chart in the <strong>Chart title </strong> box</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Name  </strong>link and enter a name for the chart in the <strong>Chart name </strong> box</li>
<li>In the <strong>Axis  </strong>section, enter a title for the vertical axis in the <strong>Vertical name </strong> box</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Horizontal </strong> link and  enter a title for the horizontal axis in the <strong>Horizontal name </strong> box</li>
<li>Define any other available options that may be associated with the chart</li>
<li>Select <strong>Insert </strong> </li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use  the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to facilitate  legibility for users who are color blind</li>
<li>Change the default colors  to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options  to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast  requirements (see <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc284929157">Technique 9</a>) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc279402215" id="_Toc279402215">Technique 7.  Provide Structure for Tables</a></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs:  Spreadsheet does not include an &ldquo;Insert Table&rdquo; feature. <strong>[Tested: December 8, 2010] </strong></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc279402216" id="_Toc279402216">Technique 8. Use Other Content  Structuring Features</a> </h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the most common method of  structuring documents, other content structuring features should be used where  appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>At this time, Google docs: Spreadsheet makes use of a  single document name. Within Google docs, this serves well as a title, but when  exporting to ODT, the document name is used to form the file name and the ODT  &ldquo;Title&rdquo; properties field is left blank. <strong>[Tested: August 20, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given a  descriptive and meaningful title. </p>
<h4>To  change the file name of the current document </h4>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Rename</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Rename Document </strong> dialog,       enter a new document name </li>
<li>Click <strong>OK </strong> </li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2  Avoid &ldquo;Floating&rdquo; Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid  &quot;floating&quot; elements (other than charts) such as floating images,  objects, tables or text boxes.<br />
  Similarly, avoid  placing drawing objects directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create  a diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert complete  graphical objects.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284929157" id="_Toc284929157">Technique 9. </a>Make Content Easier to See </h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc270691600" id="_Toc270691600">9.1 Format of Text</a></h3>
<p>When formatting  text, especially when the text is likely to be printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font       sizes between 12 and 18 points for cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts       of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts. If you do choose to use bold fonts for       emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use       standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper and lower       case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may sometimes be       easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large       amounts of text set all in caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal       or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid       animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But  can&rsquo;t users just zoom in? </strong> Office  applications do typically include accessibility features such as the ability to  magnify documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because  printing is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes  directly will change document details such the pagination, the layout of  tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a reasonable degree  of accessibility.</p>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient  Contrast></h3>
<p>The visual  presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at  least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black,       Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676,       Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast       (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a  single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
  In order to determine  whether the colors in your document have sufficient contrast, you can consult  an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy  Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast Ratio Analyzer </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe  Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe  Dolson Color Contrast Comparison </a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone </h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only  visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a  response, or distinguishing a visual element.  In order to spot where color might be the only visual means of conveying  information, you can create a screenshot of the document and then view it with  online gray-scale converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast  Accessibility Tool </a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid  Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions  provided for understanding and operating content should not rely solely on  sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content elements. Here  are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the       color of text you have edited and noting the color. Instead use Google       docs: Spreadsheet&rsquo;s review functionality features to track changes, such       as revision history.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring       to their appearance (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each image       with a figure number and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of  Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an  image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain font or  color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by styling  &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized text,  make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the techniques  noted above.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284929158" id="_Toc284929158">Technique  10. Make Content Easier to Understand</a> </h2>
<h3>10.1  Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By  taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it will be easier  to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever       possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce       acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid       making the document too &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by using lots of whitespace and by avoiding       too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content       is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within a set of       documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur consistently       each time it is repeated. </li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Navigational Instructions</h3>
<p>Provide a  general description of the spreadsheet contents and instructions on how to  navigate the data effectively. The best  way to do this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with  this information. It will be the first  cell accessed by assistive technologies.  If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can attach a comment  note to the cell containing navigational instructions. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc282436952" id="_Toc282436952">Technique 11. Check Accessibility</a> </h2>
<p><strong> </strong>At  this time, Google docs: Spreadsheet does not offer a mechanism to check for  potential accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing. <strong>[Tested:  September 20th, 2010] </strong> </p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document or  template (see <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc284929149">Technique 1</a>), then you may consider saving the file into HTML or  PDF in order to perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as  described below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template (see  <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc284929149">Technique 1</a>), one option is to save it into HTML format and use one of  the web accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool </a><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the  following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe  Acrobat Professional</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pac-pdf-accessibility-checker.html">PDF Accessibility Checker  (PAC) </a> &ndash; a free  alternative provided by &ldquo;Access for all&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat  Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full Check&hellip; </strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check </strong> dialog, select all the checking option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking </strong> button</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284929160" id="_Toc284929160">Technique 12. Use Accessibility  Features when Saving/Exporting to Other Formats</a> </h2>
<p>In some cases,  additional steps must be taken in order to ensure accessibility information is  preserved when saving/exporting to formats other than the default.</p>
<h3>Alternate  formats</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Download as </strong> </li>
<li>Select  the file type</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc273644400" id="_Toc273644400">PDF</a></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are  often called &ldquo;Tagged PDF&rdquo; because they include &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that encode structural  information required for accessibility.  To evaluate the accessibility of your PDF document, see <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc282436952">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<h3>To  clean up your HTML file</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove  unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class,  and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the  &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have  a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested  inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt; tags</li>
<li>Check  for accessibility (see <a href="googlespreadsheet.html#_Toc282436952">Technique 11</a>)<br />
  <em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help with this  process.</li>
</ul>
