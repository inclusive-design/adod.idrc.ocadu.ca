<h2><a name="_Toc285195701" id="_Toc285195701"><strong>Usage Notes</strong></a> </h2>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p>At the time of testing (February, 2011), Google  docs: Document was found not to be very accessible using keyboard navigation. In  addition, screen reader testing appeared to show important limitations.</p>
<h3><strong>Testing Details</strong></h3>
<p>Screen reader testing was performed on Firefox  3.6.13 using two popular screen readers for Windows 7, JAWS 11 and NVDA 2010.2. <br />
          Keyboard navigation testing was performed on Windows  7 using Opera 11.01.</p>

<p><strong>Other Comments by the Screen Reader Tester:</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="319" valign="top">
<p>The    documentation for using Document with a screen-reader states that when a    document loads ARIA application mode will be enabled and you will be in the    editor frame. You should be able to edit and read the document by using arrow    keys and standard keyboard commands.&nbsp;    This was very inconsistent.&nbsp; There    were times that the document would read, other times that it would not, times    that edits took effect, and times that they did not. When reading the reading    was not consistent, lines were often read out of order, when using left or    right arrows to read by character some characters would repeat or not be    spoken at all.<br />
              The    documentation also states that pressing the escape key from the editor frame    would activate the Document menu, this never worked. It was necessary to    toggle ARIA application mode on and off (JAWS key + z) to move in and out of    the editor frame to other controls on the page.&nbsp; The toggling of application mode rarely    worked as it should.&nbsp; It was necessary    to open a second Firefox window and to move to that window and then back to    Document to escape application mode.<br />
