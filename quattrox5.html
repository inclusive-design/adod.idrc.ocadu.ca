<h2><a name="_Toc284927720" id="_Toc284927720">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (September 20, 2010),  Quattro Pro X5 lacks several features that enable accessible office document  authoring, most notably: the ability to add longer descriptions to images and  objects, the ability to create your own accessible templates, or change  tracking features. As a result, some of the other features that might otherwise  support accessibility, such as its extensive templates are not as effective. In  addition, Quattro Pro X5 does not include an accessibility checking feature,  which is a more advanced accessibility feature.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Office Document&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>You should use  these techniques when you are using Quattro Pro X5 to create documents that  are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people </strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable </strong>(i.e., where dynamic features are limited to  automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not include audio,  video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows </strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations,  etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages,  applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques  will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a><strong> because these are specifically  designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or interactive content. </strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file  format for Quattro Pro X5 is <strong>Quattro Pro (QPW)</strong>. </p>
<p>In addition,  Excel 2010 offers many other spreadsheet processor and web format saving  options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility, but some  information and/or instructions are available for the following formats in <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc282436953">Technique 12</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>MS Excel</li>
<li>PDF </li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques  so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse.  However, for clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is  used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the  keyboard, select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either  (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard have this to the right of the  spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will  increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not guarantee  accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required, it  is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with  disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The application-specific steps  and screenshots in this document were created using Corel Quattro Pro X5  (ver.15.0.0.357, Windows XP, Sept. 2010). Files are also easily saved as other file formats (see <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc282436953">Technique 12</a>). </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284927721" id="_Toc284927721">Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</a> </h2>
<p><strong>  </strong>At this time, it is not possible to create your own accessible templates  in Quattro Pro X5. When using the  pre-existing templates it is important to ensure that you modify any  inaccessible aspects of the template while editing in your document. <strong>[Tested: September 14th, 2010]</strong> </p>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as a  blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document with  text, graphics and other content. For example, a &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template  might include headings for information relevant to a business meeting, such as  &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and columns for actions of the  meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,  accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is accessible,  you should check a sample document produced when the template is used (see  <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc282436952">Technique 11</a>). </p>
<p>Quattro Pro  X5&rsquo;s default template for new documents is a blank spreadsheet, which is accessible  by virtue of being blank.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284927722" id="_Toc284927722">Technique 2. Set Document Language</a> </h2>
<p><strong>  </strong>At this time, it is not possible to indicate the  natural language for specific cells or blocks of cells in Quattro Pro X5. It is only possible to set the natural  language for the current file. <strong>[Tested: September 10th, 2010]</strong> </p>
<p>In order  for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able to present your  document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural language of the  document. If a different natural  language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be  clearly indicated.</p>
<h4>To set the  language for the current file</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Thesaurus </strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Writing Tools</strong> dialog, select <strong>Options</strong>
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/QuattroProX5_1.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Options button in Writing Tools dialog." width="393" height="170" />
    </p>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Language&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Select Language</strong> dialog, select a language from the scrolling list</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/QuattroProX5_2.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Language list in Select Language dialog." width="274" height="186" />
    </p>
</li>
<li>In the <strong>Writing Tools</strong> dialog, click <strong>Close</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284927723" id="_Toc284927723">Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images  and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p><strong>  </strong>At this time, it is not possible to add longer descriptions to images  and graphical objects in a Quattro Pro X5 document. <strong>[Tested: September 14th, 2010] </strong></p>
<p>When using  images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is important  to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is also  conveyed to people who cannot see the image. This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to each  image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the alternative text  alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text alternative and a  longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what information is the       image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information,       leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the       text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a       sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or       graph), provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a       summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the       images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing  longer descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives       (see above) are insufficient to answer the question &quot;what information       is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will       be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In       these cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own       assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image       to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text       to help readers decide if they are interested in the longer description </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<h4>To add  alternative text to images and graphical objects </h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the object </li>
<li>Select <strong>Selection Properties&hellip;</strong> (F12)</li>
<li>In  the <strong>Chart</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Object Name</strong> tab</li>
<li>In  the <strong>Object Name</strong> text box, enter alternative text
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/QuattroProX5_3.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Object Name box in Chart dialog." width="271" height="257" />
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284927724" id="_Toc284927724">Technique 4. Format Your Cells</a> </h2>
<p>As you begin  adding content, your spreadsheet will require structuring to bring meaning to  the data, make it easier to navigate, and help assistive technologies read it  accurately. One of the easiest ways to  do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3>4.1  Named Styles</h3>
<p>You should make use of the named styles  that are included with the office application (e.g., &ldquo;Heading&rdquo;, &ldquo;Result&rdquo;, etc.)  before creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools  directly. Named styles help your readers  understand why something was formatted in a given way, which is especially  helpful when there are multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is  common to use italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names).<br />
  For more information on formatting using  named styles, see <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc279402217">Technique 9</a>.<br />
  <em>Note:</em> While office application  suites support headings in much the same way, the named styles often differ. <br />
  Formatting  header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet and makes it easier for  users to navigate effectively.  For  example, you can format header rows and columns using &ldquo;Heading&rdquo; styles to apply  bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics). You may also want to format cells containing  results of calculations to appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them  from the rest of your data.</p>
<h4>To format a cell  with default named styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight  the cells that you want to format<br />
    <em>Note: </em>to apply a style to an entire row or column, select the row or  column indicator and follow the next steps</li>
<li>In  the <strong>Property Bar</strong>, select the <strong>Style</strong> drop-down menu<strong> </strong></li>
<li>Select  a style to apply to the cells<strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>4.2 Other Cell Characteristics </h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly  represent your data, including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell  characteristics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight  the cells that you want to format<br />
    <em>Note: </em>to format a row or column, select the row or column indicator and  follow the next steps</li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Selection Properties&hellip;</strong> (F12)</li>
<li>In  the <strong>Active Cells</strong> dialog, select the relevant tabs (e.g. <strong>Numeric Format</strong>, <strong>Cell Font</strong>, etc.) and make your adjustments</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong><strong> <br />
  </strong><em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to  avoid merging cells. At times, it may  seem easier to present your data by merging cells, but this can make it more  difficult for users of assistive technologies and people navigating your  spreadsheet using the keyboard. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284927725" id="_Toc284927725">Technique 5. Use Cell Addressing</a> </h2>
<h3>5.1  Define Names</h3>
<p>Naming the  different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it easier to navigate  through the document and find specific information. By associating a meaningful name to a data  range, you will be enhancing the readability of your document. These named ranges can be referenced in  multiple locations of your document and within calculations and equations.</p>
<h4>To  define a name</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select  the cells you would like to name</li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Name &gt; Name cells&hellip; </strong>(Ctrl+F3) </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Name</strong> box, type a unique name<br />
    <em>Note:</em> Duplicating existing names will overwrite the previous assignment  of the name.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc278376940" id="_Toc278376940">Technique  6. Create Accessible Charts</a></h2>
<p>Charts can be  used to make data more understandable for some audiences. However, it is  important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as possible to all members  of your audience. All basic accessibility considerations that are applied  to the rest of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements  within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color  alone, to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken  to ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give  users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the  information. </p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the data to  include in the chart</li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Chart &gt; Use Chart  Expert&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Expert </strong>dialog, format  the available options and select <strong>Next &gt;</strong> after each step<br />
    <em>Note:</em> Be sure not to skip <strong>Step 3</strong>,  as it allows you to add titles and labels as you create the chart.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Finish</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the chart or  go to menu item: <strong>Chart &gt; Titles&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>Select  the available title<strong> </strong>check  boxes (e.g. <strong>Main Title</strong>, <strong>Subtitle</strong>, <strong>Footnote</strong>, <strong>X-Axis Title</strong>,  etc.)</li>
<li>Enter  descriptive meaningful titles in each of the title text boxes</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts,  use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to  facilitate legibility for users who are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts,  it is helpful to apply textures rather than colors to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors  to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options  to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast  requirements (see <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc279402217">Technique 9</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc279402215" id="_Toc279402215">Technique 7. Provide  Structure for Tables</a></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>At this time, Quattro Pro X5 does not include an &ldquo;Insert Table&rdquo; feature. <strong>[Tested: December 8, 2010]</strong></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284927728" id="_Toc284927728">Technique 8. Use Other Content Structuring Features</a> </h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the most common method of structuring  documents, other content structuring features should be used where appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted  into HTML, it should be given a descriptive and meaningful title. </p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Properties</strong> dialog, select  the <strong>Summary</strong> tag </li>
<li>In the <strong>Title</strong> box, enter the <strong>Title</strong><strong><br />
  </strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the  properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the  template name, discussed above. </li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2  Avoid &ldquo;Floating&rdquo; Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid &quot;floating&quot; elements (other than charts) such as  floating images, objects, tables or text boxes.<br />
  Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects directly into the document  (e.g., as borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with page  layout tools and insert complete graphical objects.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc279402217" id="_Toc279402217">Technique 9. </a>Make Content Easier to See </h2>
<h3>9.1  Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to be printed,  try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight       fonts. If you do choose to use bold       fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper       and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may       sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,       Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed       spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But  can&rsquo;t users just zoom in?</strong>Office applications do typically include accessibility features such as  the ability to magnify documents and support for high contrast modes. However,  because printing is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font  sizes directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout of  tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a reasonable degree  of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the  text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Define Styles&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Define Style For</strong> text box, type  the style name or click the arrow to open a drop-down menu where you can select  the style you want to modify from the list</li>
<li>Click <strong>Font</strong>
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/QuattroProX5_4.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Define Style For box and Font button in Styles dialog." width="331" height="184" />
    </p>
</li>
<li>In  the <strong>Size</strong> drop-down menu,  select a font size between 12 and 18 points</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK
<p>
      <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/QuattroProX5_5.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Size option in Font dialog." width="330" height="264" />
    </p>
<p>  </p></strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Styles</strong> dialog, click <strong>OK </strong></li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc270691601" id="_Toc270691601">9.2 Use  Sufficient Contrast</a></h3>
<p>The visual  presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at  least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black,       Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast       (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast       (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always  use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
  In order to  determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient contrast, you can  consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy  Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast Ratio Analyzer </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe  Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe  Dolson Color Contrast Comparison </a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>&lt;9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone </h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only  visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a  response, or distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be the only visual means of conveying  information, you can create a screenshot of the document and then view it with  online gray-scale converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast  Accessibility Tool </a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory  Characteristics</h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply       changing the color of text you have edited and noting the color. Instead       use the application&rsquo;s change tracking feature to track changes.<strong> </strong>At this time, Quattro Pro X5 does not offer a change tracking feature. <strong>[Tested:  September 20th, 2010]</strong></li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring       to their appearance (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each image       with a figure number and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5  Avoid Using Images of Text </h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to  ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve  the same result by styling &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos  containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image  following the techniques noted <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc284927723">Technique 3</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284927730" id="_Toc284927730">Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</a> </h2>
<h3>10.1  Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it will  be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever       possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce       acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid       making the document too &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by using lots of whitespace and by avoiding       too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content       is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within a set of       documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur consistently       each time it is repeated. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc273696206" id="_Toc273696206">10.2 Navigational  Instructions</a></h3>
<p>Provide a  general description of the spreadsheet contents and instructions on how to  navigate the data effectively. The best  way to do this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with  this information. It will be the first  cell accessed by assistive technologies. If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can attach a comment  note to the cell containing navigational instructions. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc282436952" id="_Toc282436952">Technique 11. Check Accessibility</a> </h2>
<p><strong>  </strong>At this time, Quattro Pro X5 does not offer an accessibility checking  feature to identify potential accessibility errors in your document prior to  publishing. <strong>[Tested: September 20th, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document or  template (see <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc284927721">Technique 1</a>), then you may consider saving the file into HTML or  PDF in order to perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as  described below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML  accessibility </h4>
<p>If you wish to  check the accessibility of your document or template (see <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc284927721">Technique 1</a>),  one option is to save it into HTML format and use one of the web accessibility  checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM Wave Web  Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF  accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the  following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Acrobat Professional</li>
<li><a href="http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pac-pdf-accessibility-checker.html">PDF Accessibility Checker (PAC)</a> &ndash; a free alternative provided by  &ldquo;Access for all&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF  accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced  &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full Check&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Full  Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start  Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc282436953" id="_Toc282436953">Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to Other  Formats</a> </h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure  accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats other  than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p><strong>  </strong>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible  PDF documents are often called &ldquo;Tagged PDF&rdquo; because they include &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that  encode structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the accessibility of your PDF  document, see <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc282436952">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Publish to Internet</strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Ranges and charts to convert</strong> section, click the <strong>Range Picker</strong> </li>
<li>Select  a range of cells</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Export range as</strong> area, enable either the <strong>Table</strong> or <strong>Text</strong> options</li>
<li>Type  a path and filename in the <strong>Save file</strong> box</li>
<li>Check  the HTML file for accessibility (see <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc282436952">Technique 11</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h3>To clean  up your HTML file</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove  unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class,  and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the  &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have  a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested  inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt; tags</li>
<li>Check  for accessibility (see <a href="quattrox5.html#_Toc282436952">Technique 11</a>)<br />
  <em>Note:</em> you  may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help with this process.</li>
</ul>
