<h2><a name="_Toc279394416" id="_Toc279394416">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (September 20, 2010), OpenOffice  Impress provides a set of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable  the production of accessible digital office documents. However, OpenOffice  Impress does not include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Office Document&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>You  should use these techniques when you are using Impress to create documents that  are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended  to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images,  although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully  printable</strong> (i.e.,  where dynamic features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of  contents, etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to  other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical  of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating  forms, web pages, applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content,  these techniques will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a><strong> because these are specifically designed to provide guidance  for highly dynamic and/or interactive content.</strong> </p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The  default file format for Impress is <strong>ODF  Presentation (ODP)</strong>. </p>
<p>In  addition, Impress offers many other presentation processor and web format  saving options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility, but some  information and/or instructions are available for the following formats in <a href="ooimpress.html#_Toc284333461">Technique 12</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>MS PowerPoint (PPT)</li>
<li>PDF </li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate  these techniques so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether  they use a mouse. However, for clarity there are several instances where  mouse-only language is used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the  Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard  have this to the right of the spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing  Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these  techniques will increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not  guarantee accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more  certainty is required, it is recommended that you test the office documents  with end users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The  application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were created using  OpenOffice Impress (ver. 3.2.1, Windows XP, Aug. 2010) while creating an ODT  document. Files can also be easily saved  as other file formats (see <a href="ooimpress.html#_Toc284333461">Technique 12</a>).</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc285025534" id="_Toc285025534">Technique 1. Use  Accessible Templates</a></h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template,  which can be as simple as a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly  complete document with text, graphics and other content. For example, a  &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template might include headings for information relevant to a  business meeting, such as &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and  columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point  for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a  template is accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the  template is used (see <a href="ooimpress.html#_Toc284333460">Technique 11</a>). </p>
<p>OpenOffice Impress&rsquo;s default template for new  documents is a blank presentation. The basic installation also includes blank  business card and blank label templates.  These are all accessible by virtue of being blank. As well, you may  create your own templates. </p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you  follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished  you should also check the accessibility of the document (see <a href="ooimpress.html#_Toc284333460">Technique 11</a>)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> to  indicate the accessibility status of the template. Using <strong>Title</strong> (e.g., &ldquo;Accessible Memo Template&rdquo;) will increase the prominence of the  accessibility status because this is used in place of the template&rsquo;s file name. <strong>Comments</strong> can be used to add more information if necessary (e.g., &ldquo;This memo template has  been checked for accessibility.&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK
<p>
   <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOImpress1.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Title box and Comments box in Properties dialog." width="529" height="390" />
   </p>
<p>  </p></strong></li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Templates &gt; Save </strong>(Shift+F11)</li>
<li>In  the <strong>New Template</strong> box, type a name for the  template</li>
<li>Select  the category you would like to save it in, under <strong>Categories<br />
  </strong><em>Note:</em> the category is simply the folder into which you are saving the template</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK
<p>
      <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOImpress2.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of New template name box and Categories list in Templates dialog." width="552" height="233" />
    </p>
<p>  </p></strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible  template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available (e.g.  that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Templates and  Documents</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Templates</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select a template  document from the list<br />
  <em>Note:</em> A  properties pane appears on the right side of the window, where you can read the  document properties (Title, By, Date, Modified by, Modified on, Description, and  Size). If you placed information about the accessibility of the template in the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> when you created the template (see above), this will be displayed in the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Description</strong>,  respectively. </li>
<li>Select <strong>Open</strong><strong>
<p>
      <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOImpress3.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Templates icon, Title and Description sections in My Templates dialog." width="630" height="433" />
    </p>
<p>  </p></strong></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have chosen  an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text,  images, etc.), ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve  accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc285025535" id="_Toc285025535">Technique 2. Set  Document Language</a></h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able  to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural  language of the document. If a different  natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to  be clearly indicated.  </p>
<h4>To select a language for  the whole document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools  &gt; Options</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Language  Settings &gt; Languages</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Default languages for documents</strong>,  select the document language for all newly created documents<br />
    <em>Note:</em> If  you mark <strong>For the current document only</strong>,  your choice will only apply to the current document. </li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK</strong></li>
<p>
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOImpress4.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of language option in Languages dialog." width="735" height="384" />  </p>
<p><h4>To apply a language  directly to selected text</h4>
</p></ol>
<ol>
<li>Select the text to which you want  to apply a language </li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Character</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>
<p>

  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="tech3" id="tech3"></a>Technique 3. Use  Built-In Layout and Styling Features</h2>
<h3><a name="tech3.1" id="tech3.1"></a>3.1 Use Built-In Slide  Layouts</h3>
<p>Instead  of creating each slide in your presentation by starting from a blank slide,  check whether there is a suitable built-in layout. </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The built-in layouts can be more accessible to users of assistive technologies  because they technologies sometimes read the floating items on the slide in the  order that they were placed on the slide. The built-in layouts have usually  taken this into account (e.g., &ldquo;Title&rdquo; first followed by other items, left to  right and from top to bottom). If you create slide layouts from scratch, it is  sometimes difficult to keep track of the order elements were placed.</p>
<h4>To apply &ldquo;true layout&rdquo; to a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the slide in  the <strong>Slides</strong> pane on the left</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Slide Layout&hellip;</strong></li>
<li>Go to <strong>Tasks</strong> pane on the right</li>
<li>Select layout under  the <strong>Layouts</strong> section
<p>
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOImpress6.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Layouts section in Tasks pane." width="206" height="462" />
  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Use Quick Styles</h3>
<p>You should make use of the  quick styles that are included with the office application (e.g., pre-defined  heading fonts and characters) before creating your own styles or using the  character formatting tools directly. Quick styles help your readers understand  why something was formatted in a given way, which is especially helpful when  there are multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use  italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in much the same  way, the named styles often differ. </p>
<p>Impress provides quick styles  for theme fonts, but applying these directly to text does not define the text  as a heading or body font. To define the  font for headings and body text, you need to apply these characteristics to the  presentation theme.</p>
<p>Impress provides named styles  for &ldquo;Heading&rdquo;, &ldquo;Title&rdquo;, etc., but not for strong and emphasis.</p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting </strong>(F11)</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Graphic Styles </strong>icon</li>
<li>Select the named  style</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Bucket </strong>icon in the element to  which you would like to apply the named style</li>
<li>Close the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog
<p>
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOImpress7.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Graphic Styles icon and Bucket icon in Styles and Formatting dialog." width="240" height="373" />
  </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong> (F11)</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from  the list</li>
<li>Right click and select: <strong>Modify&hellip;</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select a font size under <strong>Size</strong></li>
<li>Exit with <strong>OK</strong>
<p>
      <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOImpress8.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Font tab and Size options in Paragraphy Style dialog." width="529" height="406" />
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.3 Customize Using Master Slides</h3>
<p>If a layout must be customized,  it is recommended that Master Slides be used.</p>
<p>Every slide layout in a  presentation is defined by its master slide.  A master slide determines the formatting style for various elements of  the slide layout. This includes font  styles, character formatting, and the positioning of elements. Essentially, each master slide acts as a  design template for the slide layout. </p>
<p>If you edit any aspect of the  slide layout in the master slide, the change will affect all slides that were  created based on it. For this reason, it  is good practice to edit the master slide and use the slide layouts before  building individual slides. It is  essential that you create and use master slides that meet the accessibility  requirements outlined in this document.</p>
<h4>To modify a  Master Slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Master &gt; Slide Master</strong> </li>
<li>Edit the master  slide, ensuring it aligns with the guidelines in this document</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284333453" id="_Toc284333453">Technique 4. Set a  Logical Tab Order</a></h2>
<p>Many presentation applications create content composed almost exclusively  of &quot;floating&quot; objects. This means that they avoid the transitions  between in-line content and secondary &quot;floating&quot; objects (text boxes,  images, etc.) that can cause accessibility issues in word processors. </p>
<p>
  However, when you are working with &quot;floating&quot; objects, it is  important to remember that the way objects are positioned in two dimensions on  the screen may be completely different from how the objects will be read by a  screen reader or navigated using a keyboard. The order that content is navigated  sequentially is called the &quot;Tab Order&quot; because often the  &quot;Tab&quot; key is used to navigate from one &quot;floating&quot; object to  the next.</p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips  for setting a logical &ldquo;tab order&rdquo; for &quot;floating&quot; objects</h3>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The tab order of floating objects is usually from the &ldquo;lowest&rdquo; object on  the slide to the &ldquo;highest&rdquo;. </li>
<li>Because objects automatically appear &ldquo;on top&rdquo; when they are inserted,  the default tab order is from the first object inserted to the last. However,  this will change if you use features such as &ldquo;bring to front&rdquo; and &ldquo;send to  back&rdquo;. </li>
<li>The slide&rsquo;s main heading should be first in the tab order.</li>
<li>Headings should be placed in the tab order immediately before the items  (text, diagrams, etc.) for which they are acting as a heading.</li>
<li>Labels should be in the reading order placed immediately before the  objects that they label.</li>
<li>For simple slide layouts, it may be possible to simply insert objects in  a logical tab order.</li>
<li>For more complex layouts, it may be easier to simply to create the slide  as usual and then set the tab order (see below).</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>
<h4>To set the tab order</h4></p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Arrange &gt; Bring to Front</strong>, <strong>Bring  Forward</strong>, <strong>Send Backward</strong>, or <strong>Send  to Back</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc285025538" id="_Toc285025538">Technique 5. Use Slide Notes</a></h2>
<p>A useful aspect of presentation  applications is the facility to add notes to slides, which can then be read by  assistive technologies. You can use  these slide notes to explain and expand on the contents of your slides in text  format. Slide notes can be created as  you build your presentation.</p>
<h4>To add notes to your slides</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Notes Page</strong></li>
<li>In the text box  positioned at the bottom of the page, select <strong>Click to add notes</strong></li>
<li>Enter notes to  accompany the slide</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc285025539" id="_Toc285025539">Technique 6.  Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a></h2>
<p>When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is  important to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is  also conveyed to people who cannot see the image. This can be accomplished by adding concise  alternative text to of each image. If an image is too complicated to concisely  describe in the alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a  short text alternative and a longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what       information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful       information, leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text,       ensure all of the text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short,       usually a sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g.,       for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the alternative text       (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description,       see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing longer  descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when       text alternatives (see above) are insufficient to answer the question       &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information       being conveyed will be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural       detail, etc.). In these cases, try to describe the image without making       too many of your own assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are       describing the image to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise       alternative text to help readers decide if they are interested in the       longer description </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<h4>To add alternative text to images </h4>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Right-click       on object </li>
<li>Select <strong>Description... </strong>option </li>
<li>Enter       alternative text in the <strong>Title </strong>box

</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add long descriptions to images</h4>

<h2><a name="_Toc285025540" id="_Toc285025540">Technique 7. Use Built-In Structuring  Features</a></h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is  important to ensure that they are clear and appropriately structured. This  helps all users to better understand the information in the table and allows  assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to provide context so that the information  within the table can be conveyed in a meaningful way. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for tables</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information,       not for formatting.</li>
<li>Use &ldquo;real tables&rdquo; rather than text       formatted to look like tables using the TAB key or space bar. These will       not be recognized by assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged       cells and dividing complex data sets into separate smaller tables, where       possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the       header to show at the top of each page. Also set the table to break       between rows instead of in the middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text  summary of the essential table contents. Any abbreviations used should be  explained in the summary. </li>
<li>Table       captions or descriptions should answer the question &quot;what is the       table's purpose and how is it organized?&quot; (e.g., &quot;A sample order       form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity&quot;). </li>
<li>Table       cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as labels to help       interpret the other cells in the table. </li>
<li>Table       header cells labels should be concise and clear. </li>
<li>Ensure       the table is not &ldquo;floating&rdquo; on the page (see <a href="ooimpress.html#_Toc284333453">Technique 4</a>).
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<h4>To add a table with  headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table&hellip;</strong></li>

<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When  you create lists, it is important to format them as &ldquo;real lists&rdquo;. Otherwise,  assistive technologies will interpret your list as a series of short separate  paragraphs instead of a coherent list of related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or  unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Bullets and Numbering</strong></li>
<li>For unordered lists,  select an option from the <strong>Bullets</strong> tab</li>
<li>For ordered lists,  select an option from the <strong>Numbering  Type</strong> tab </li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Bullets and Numbering</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Customize </strong>tab</li>
<li>Modify the list style by making  selections from the available formatting options</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK <br />
  </strong><em>Note:  </em>This only modifies that instance of the list style.</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing  text in columns. </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Because  columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive technologies, consider  whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Document Title</h3>
<p>In  case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given a descriptive  and meaningful title. </p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Description</strong> tab </li>
<li>Type  the new title in the <strong>Title</strong> box and click <strong>OK</strong></li>
<p><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined  in the properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the  template name, discussed above.</p>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc278376940" id="_Toc278376940">Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</a></h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data  more understandable for some audiences. However, it is important to  ensure that your chart is as accessible as possible to all members of your  audience. All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the  rest of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements  within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color  alone, to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken  to ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give  users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the  information. </p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select  a slide layout with a placeholder for data charts (see <a href="ooimpress.html#tech3.1">Technique 3.1</a>)</li>
<li>Double-click*  the center of the placeholder to insert the data chart</li>
<li>Right-click*  the chart and select <strong>Chart  Data Table&hellip;</strong></li>
<li>Update  the data table with the data you would like to display</li>
<li>Close the  data table</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double-click* the chart to  access the chart menus</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Titles</strong></li>
<li>Update the relevant fields  and select <strong>OK</strong></li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Data Labels</strong></li>
<li>Configure your data label  selections and select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different  predefined Chart Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double-click* the chart to  access the chart menus</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Chart Type</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Type</strong> dialog, select a predefined chart type and style</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts,  use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to  facilitate legibility for users who are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it  is helpful to apply textures instead of color to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors  to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options  to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast  requirements (see <a href="ooimpress.html#tech9.2">Technique 9.2</a>) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc285025542" id="_Toc285025542">Technique 9.  Make Content Easier to See</a></h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When  formatting text, especially when the text is likely to be printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for       body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than       bold or light weight fonts. If you       do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing       and easily recognized upper and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts       (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts       (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in       caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character       spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can&rsquo;t users just  zoom in?</strong> Office applications do typically  include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify documents and  support for high contrast modes. However, because printing is an important  aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes directly will change documents  details such the pagination, the layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to  always format text for a reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><a name="tech9.2" id="tech9.2"></a>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The  visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ration of  at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black,       Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast       (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast       (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also,  always use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.</p>
<p>In  order to determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient  contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast  Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using  Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color  should not be used as the only visual means of conveying information,  indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual  element. In order to spot where color might  be the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a screenshot  of the document and then view it with online gray-scale converting tools, such  as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit  v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on  Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing       the color of text you have edited and noting the color. Instead use PowerPoint       2010&rsquo;s &ldquo;Track Changes&rdquo; feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by       referring to their appearance (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each       image with a figure number and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of  Text</h3>
<p>Before  you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain  font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by  styling &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized  text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the  techniques noted, above.</p>
<h3>9.6 Avoid  Transitions</h3>
<p>Transitions  between slides and elements in each slide (e.g., bullets in a list flying onto  the screen) can be distracting to users with disabilities. It can also cause assistive technologies to  read the slide incorrectly. For these  reasons, it is best to avoid transitions altogether.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc279394424" id="_Toc279394424">Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</a></h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in  a consistent way, it will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all  users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever possible, write       clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and       spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document       too &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by using lots of whitespace and by avoiding too many different       colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on       multiple pages within a document or within a set of documents (e.g.,       headings, footings, etc.), it should occur consistently each time it is       repeated. </li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks  are more effective navigation aids when the user understands the likely result of following the link. Otherwise, users may have to use trial-and-error to find  what they need.</p>
<p>To  help the user understand the result of selecting a hyperlink, ensure that the  link makes sense when read in the context of the text around it. For example,  while it would be confusing to use &ldquo;more information&rdquo; as a link by itself on a  page, it would be fine to use &ldquo;more information&rdquo; as a link in the following  sentence: &ldquo;The airport can be reached by taxi or bus (<u>more information</u>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  make the address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the  address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To change link  text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Type the link address and <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Highlight the link</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Edit &gt; Hyperlink&hellip;</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Hyperlink</strong> dialog, type meaningful  descriptive text of the hyperlink in the field labeled <strong>Text</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Apply</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc278368481" id="_Toc278368481">10.3 Accessible  Presentations</a></h3>

<h2><a name="_Toc284333460" id="_Toc284333460">Technique 11. Check Accessibility</a></h2>
<p>At this time, OpenOffice Impress  does not offer a mechanism to identify potential accessibility errors in your  document prior to publishing. <strong>[Tested:  September 20th, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the  accessibility of your document or template (see <a href="ooimpress.html#_Toc285025534">Technique 1</a>), then you may  consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an accessibility  check in one of those formats, as described below. </p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of  your document or template (see <a href="ooimpress.html#_Toc285025534">Technique 1</a>), one option is to save it  into HTML format and use one of the web accessibility checkers available  online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker </a></li>
<li> <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility  Evaluation Tool </a><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF  format, you can use the following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility  of the PDF document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Acrobat  Professional</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pac-pdf-accessibility-checker.html">PDF Accessibility Checker (PAC) </a> &ndash;  a free alternative provided by &ldquo;Access for all&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>

<h2><a name="_Toc284333461" id="_Toc284333461">Technique 12. Use  Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to Other Formats</a></h2>
<p>In  some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure accessibility  information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats other than the  default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible.  Accessible PDF documents are often called &ldquo;Tagged PDF&rdquo; because they include  &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that encode structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the accessibility of your PDF  document, see <a href="ooimpress.html#_Toc284333460">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go to menu item: File &gt; Export as  PDF</strong></li>
<li><strong>Check box labeled Tagged PDF</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Click  Export</strong></li>
<li>Enter name and save  location</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
<p><em>Note:</em> You must ensure this option is selected in the PDF Options window dialog box  before using PDF icon on menu bar.
</p></ol>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open  the presentation that you want to save in HTML format.</li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>File  &gt; </strong><strong>Export</strong></li>
<li>Set  the <strong>File type</strong> to <strong>HTML </strong><strong>Document (OpenOffice.org  Impress) (.html;.htm)</strong>.</li>

</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML  file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary  styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id,  class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the  &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt;  tags have a scope attribute</li>
