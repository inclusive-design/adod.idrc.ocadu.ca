<h2><a name="Usage" id="Usage">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>The techniques described in this document apply both to <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/">OpenOffice Writer 3.4.0</a> and <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/">LibreOffice 4.0.4.2</a>. There are sometimes minor differences in the toolbars and dialogs between the two office suites, but these differences do not require different instructions.</p>
<p>At the time of testing (July 2013),  Writer provides a set of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable  the production of accessible digital office documents. An accessibility checking feature is available by installing the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/accessodf/wiki/UserGuide/">AccessODF extension</a>.</p>
<p>This guide is intended to be used for documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended  to be used by people</strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images,  although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully  printable</strong>(i.e.,  where dynamic features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of  contents, etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to  other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical  of office-style workflows </strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating  forms, web pages, applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content,  these techniques will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a><strong> because these are specifically designed to provide guidance  for highly dynamic and/or interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The  default file format for Writer is <strong>Open  Document Text (ODT)</strong>. In  addition, Writer offers many other word processor and web format saving  options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility, but some  information and/or instructions are available for the following formats in <a href="oowriter.html#tech12">Technique  12</a>.</p>
<h3>Document Conventions
</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate  these techniques so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether  they use a mouse. However, for clarity there are several instances where  mouse-only language is used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard  alternatives: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the  Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard  have this to the right of the spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several techniques refer to the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog. By default, this is a floating dialog but it can also be docked, so it becomes a panel. When the dialog or panel is open, keyboard users can navigate to it using the key F6. The same applies to the <strong>Navigator</strong>, which can either float over the editing area or be docked next to it. </p>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these  techniques will increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not  guarantee accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>.  In cases where more  certainty is required, it is recommended that you test the office documents  with end users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The  application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were created using  Writer (ver. 3.4.0, Windows 7, 32 bits, July 2013) while creating an ODT document.</li>
<li>This document is provided for information purposes only and is neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results. If errors are found, please report them to: <a href="mailto:adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca">adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="tech1" id="tech1">Technique 1. Use  Accessible Templates</a></h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template,  which can be as simple as a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly  complete document with text, graphics and other content. For example, a  &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template might include headings for information relevant to a  business meeting, such as &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and  columns for actions of the meeting. Because templates provide the starting-point  for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a  template is accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the template  is used (see <a href="oowriter.html#tech11">Technique 11</a>). </p>
<p>Writer&rsquo;s default template for new documents is  a blank page. The basic installation also includes blank business card and  blank label templates.  These are all  fairly accessible by virtue of being blank. However, you should make the default language of a template unambiguous (see <a href="oowriter.html#tech2">Technique 2</a>).</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible  templates from scratch in Writer.  As  well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged templates, ensuring  their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible  template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document  (either blank or from an existing template)</li>
<li>Ensure that you  follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished  you should also check the accessibility of the document (See Accessibility  Checking, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong> </li>
<li>Use the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> to  indicate the accessibility status of the template. Using <strong>Title</strong> (e.g., &ldquo;Accessible Memo Template&rdquo;) will increase the prominence of the  accessibility status because this is used in place of the template&rsquo;s file name. <strong>Comments</strong> can be used to add more information if necessary (e.g., &ldquo;This memo template has  been checked for accessibility.&rdquo;).<br />
<img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter1.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Title and Comments text box in Properties dialog." width="555" height="443" /> </li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK</strong> </li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Templates &gt; Save</strong></li>
<li>In  the <strong>New Template</strong> box, type a name for the  template</li>
<li>Select  the category you would like to save it in, under <strong>Categories<br />
  </strong><em>Note:</em> the category is simply the folder into which you are saving the template<br />
<img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter2.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of New Template box and Categories options in the Templates dialog." width="580" height="268" /> </li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an  accessible template </h4>
<p>Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available (e.g.  that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Templates and  Documents</strong> </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Templates</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select a template  document from the list<br />
  <em>Note:</em> A  properties pane appears on the right side of the window, where you can read the  document properties (Title, By, Date, Modified by, Modified on, Description,  and Size). If you placed information about the accessibility of the template in  the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> when you created the template (see above), this will be displayed in the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Description</strong>,  respectively.<br />
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter3.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Templates icon, Title, and Description in the My Templates dialog." width="662" height="454" /> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Open</strong> </li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have chosen  an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text,  images, etc.), ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve  accessibility.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="tech2" id="tech2">Technique 2. Specify  Document Language</a> </h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able  to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural language  of the document.  If a different natural  language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be  clearly indicated.</p>
<h4>To select a  language for the whole document </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools  &gt; Options</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Language  Settings &gt; Languages</strong> </li>
<li>Under <strong>Default languages for documents</strong>,  select the document language for all newly created documents.<br />
    <em>Note:</em> Writer uses three categories of languages: “Western languages”, “Asian languages” and CTL languages (complex text layout). For monolingual documents in a Western language, you should change the values for Asian languages and CTL languages from their defaults to “None”. Under default languages for documents, enable “Show UI elements for UI elements for East Asian languages” and “Show UI elements for Bi-Directional writing”. Then set the values for Asian and CTL to “None”. You can then again disable the UI elements for these languages again.<br />
    <em>Tip:</em> Do this for all your templates.</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK<br />
  </strong><br />
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter4.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Language option in Languages dialog." width="776" height="442" /> </li>
</ol>
<h4>To select a  language for a paragraph style </h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in the paragraph  using the paragraph style you want to edit </li>
<li>Right-click* and go to menu item: <strong>Edit Paragraph Style</strong> </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font </strong>tab </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> and select <strong>OK</strong><br />
    <em>Note:</em> All paragraphs formatted with  the current paragraph style will have the selected language.<br />
<img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter5.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Language drop-down menu in Paragraph Style dialog." width="555" height="461" />
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>To select a language for hyperlinks</h4>
<p>The default language of hyperlinks in Writer is “None”. If all or most hyperlinks in a document are in the same language, you should modify the style for hyperlinks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Character Styles</strong> icon </li>
<li>Right-click* on the style <strong>Internet Link </strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify... </strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab </li>
<li>Set the language to <strong>English</strong> (or the Western language that you use most). If the UI for non-Western languages is enabled, set the non-Western languages to “None”. <br />
  <em>  Tip:</em> Set the language for the style Internet Link in all your templates.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a  language directly to selected text </h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text to which you want  to apply a language </li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Character</strong> </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font </strong>tab </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> </li>
<li>If the UI for non-Western languages is enabled, set the non-Western languages to “None”.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="tech3" id="tech3">Technique 3. Provide  Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p>Some  issues have been observed with Writer  involving the loss of alternative  text and longer descriptions (e.g., when images anchored to a paragraph are  changed to anchor as characters, when a caption is added). We suggest that you guard against this data  loss by keeping backups and by setting image anchoring and captions before adding the alternative text.</p>
<p> When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is  important to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is  also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.  This can be accomplished by adding concise  alternative text to of each image. If an image is too complicated to concisely  describe in the alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a  short text alternative and a longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above) are insufficient to answer the question &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help readers decide if they are interested in the longer description  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> When inserting a new image or object in place of an existing image or object,  the alternative text and description will remain the same.  This is helpful if you are inserting an  updated version of an image, whose meaning and context has not change.  However, when inserting an entirely new image  or object, you will be required to change the title and description fields  accordingly.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> When inserting a picture or object that is too large for the height or width of  the page, it is best to reduce the size before inserting it into the  document.  This results in a smaller file  size and usually better image quality.</p>
<h4>To add alternative text to images  and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click*  the object </li>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Picture</strong> </li>
<li>Select  the <strong>Options</strong> tab in <strong>Picture</strong> dialog </li>
<li>Fill  in <strong>Alternative  Text</strong> box<br />
      <em>Note:</em> the <strong>Alternative  Text </strong>is also the <strong>Title</strong> of  the object<br />
<img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter6.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Alternate Text box in the Picture dialog." width="555" height="443" />
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>To add long  descriptions to images </h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* on object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Description</strong><strong>...</strong> option</li>
<li>Enter description in <strong>Description</strong> box<br />
<img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter7.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Description box in the Description dialog." width="375" height="225" />
  </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="tech4" id="tech4">Technique  4. Avoid &ldquo;Floating&rdquo; Elements</a></h2>
<p>When images and objects are inserted into Writer documents they default to  &ldquo;floating&rdquo; with an anchor &ldquo;To Paragraph&rdquo;. This makes them difficult to select  with the keyboard, so &ldquo;floating&rdquo; should be prevented by anchoring them &ldquo;As  Character&rdquo;. </p>
<p>A  &ldquo;floating&rdquo; object keeps its position relative to the page, while text flows  around it.  As content moves up or down  on the page, the object stays where it was placed.  To ensure that images and objects remain with  the text that references it, always position it has attached to a character at  the end of the in-text reference.</p>
<p>Similarly, avoid placing  drawing objects directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create a  diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert complete  graphical objects.</p>
<h4>To prevent an image or  object from &ldquo;floating&rdquo;</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click*  the object </li>
<li>Select <strong>Anchor &gt; As  Character</strong> option </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="tech5" id="tech5">Technique 5. Use  Headings</a> </h2>
<p>Any  documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require structuring to make  them more straightforward for readers to understand. <strong>One of the easiest ways to do this is  to use &ldquo;True Headings&rdquo; to </strong>create logical  divisions between paragraphs. True headings are more than just bolded,  enlarged, or centered text; they are structural elements that order and levels  provide a meaningful sequence to users of assistive technologies.</p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<h3>Tips for headings</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use the default headings styles provided (&ldquo;Heading &ldquo;, &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo;, etc.)</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the sub-headings of a &ldquo;Heading 1&rdquo; are &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo;, etc.)</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>To apply  headings from the Formatting Toolbar</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight  the text that you want to make into a navigational heading </li>
<li>Select  the desired heading from the dropdown list in the <strong>Formatting Toolbar<br />
  </strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter8.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Heading drop-down menu in Formatting toolbar." width="188" height="224" />  </li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply headings  using the Styles and Formatting panel </h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text  that you want to make into a navigational heading</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong> </li>
<li>Double-click* the  desired heading style<br />
    <em>Note:</em> If  a heading style is modified in the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> panel, the modification will apply to every heading of that style</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply  headings using keyboard shortcuts (up to Heading 5)</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text  that you want to make into a navigational heading</li>
<li>Select Ctrl+1 (for Heading 1), Ctrl+2  (for Heading 2), ... Ctrl+5 (for Heading 5)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong> (F11)</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from  the list</li>
<li>Right-click* and select: <strong>Modify&hellip; </strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph Style</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Organizer </strong>tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> box, enter a unique style  name </li>
<li>Format the heading style using  the available formatting options in the various tabs.  Make sure your selections align with the  techniques in this document.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="tech6" id="tech6">Technique 6. Use Named Styles</a></h2>
<p>As with &ldquo;True Headings&rdquo; (see  <a href="oowriter.html#tech5">Technique 5</a>), you should attempt to make use of the named styles that are  included with the office application (e.g., &ldquo;emphasis&rdquo;, &ldquo;caption&rdquo;, etc.) before  creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly.  Named styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a  given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons for the  same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis, Latin terms  and species names).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in much the same  way, the named styles often differ. </p>
<p>Writer provides named “paragraph styles” for “caption”, “endnote”, etc. Styles for  strong emphasis, emphasis, source code and quotations are not paragraph styles but “character styles”. You can access character styles by selecting the<strong> Character Styles</strong> icon in the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog.</p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Default named styles can be applied the  same way as headings (see <a href="oowriter.html#tech5">Technique 5</a>). </li>
</ol>
<h2> <a name="tech7" id="tech7">Technique </a>7. Use Built-In Document  Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is  important to ensure that they are clear and appropriately structured. This  helps all users to better understand the information in the table and allows  assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to provide context so that the  information within the table can be conveyed in a meaningful way. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as to position columns.</li>
<li>Use &ldquo;real tables&rdquo; rather than text formatted to look like tables using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>Always set the header to show at the top of each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text  summary of the essential table contents. Any abbreviations used should be  explained in the summary. </li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question &quot;what is the table's purpose and how is it organized?&quot; (e.g., &quot;A sample order form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity&quot;).  </li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as labels to help interpret the other cells in the table. </li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table</strong> (Ctrl+F12)</li>
<li>Enter a name for the table</li>
<li>Specify the number of columns and  rows in the table</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Heading</strong> check box</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Repeat  heading</strong> check box</li>
<li>Indicate the number of rows you  want to use for the heading in <strong>The first&hellip;rows</strong> spinner box<br />
    <em>Note:</em> Whenever possible, keep tables  simple with just 1 row of headings.<br />
<img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter9.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Heading check box, Repeat heading option, and The first...rows spinner box in the Insert Table dialog." width="580" height="339" />  </li>
</ol>
<h4>To add table headings manually</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the table cells that  should be headers</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt;</strong> <strong>Styles  and Formatting </strong>(F11) </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Heading</strong> check box and make sure that <strong>Repeat heading</strong> is checked</li>
</ol>
<h4>To make tables break between rows instead of in the middle of rows</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor inside the table  </li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table</strong> &gt; <strong>Table Properties</strong> </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Text Flow</strong> tab  </li>
<li>Unselect the check box <strong>Allow row to break across pages and columns</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When  you create lists, it is important to format them as &ldquo;real lists&rdquo;. Otherwise,  assistive technologies will interpret your list as a series of short separate  paragraphs instead of a coherent list of related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<p>This applies a paragraph style for lists that makes sure that assistive technology and other software can recognise the content as a list.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog, select a list style such as List 1 or Numbering 1. <br />
  <em>Note:</em> Do not select the style “List”: this style is reserved for modifying all list styles or numbering styles at once. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are two methods for adding visual list formatting to this list: the first one modifies the applied paragraph style:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong></li>
<li>Right-click* the paragraph style you applied to the content (e.g., List 1 or Numbering 1)  </li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify...</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph Style</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Outline &amp; Numbering</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Numbering Style</strong> (this drop-down list also contains styles for unordered lists) </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Indents and Spacing</strong> tab </li>
<li>Set the indent values you would like to use for this list type </li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The second method changes the visual formatting of a list without changing all lists based on the same style:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the list   </li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Bullets and Numbering </strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Bullets</strong> tab for unordered lists or the <strong>Numbering</strong> <strong>type</strong> tab for ordered lists </li>
<li>Select a list style from the <strong>Selection</strong> gallery  </li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create sublists</h4>
<p>This is the only way to create a true sublist (i.e. a list that is (internally) a child list of the list item above it) instead of a list that is merely indented more from the margin.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the list items that should become a sublist</li>
<li>On the <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong> toolbar, select the button <strong>Demote One Level</strong> or the button <strong>Demote One Level with Subpoints</strong><br />
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter-sublists.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of 'demote one level' and 'demote one level with sublists' buttons on the 'bullets and numbering' toolbar." width="400" height="52" /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create new list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog, select the <strong>List Styles</strong> icon </li>
<li>Right-click* a style from the  list</li>
<li>Select <strong>New&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Numbering Style</strong> dialog, enter a name for the  list style in the <strong>Name</strong> box</li>
<li>Format the list using the  available formatting options in the various tabs</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: </em>This does not create new paragraph styles but new formatting styles that you can apply to paragraph styles for lists. Even though the names for the formatting styles (List 1, Numbering 1 etc.) that appear when you select the List Styles icon are the same as some of the paragraph styles that appear when you select the Paragraph Styles icon, their purpose is different: the Paragraph Styles are for document structure and other paragraph features (e.g. indent), the List Styles are for the numbering or bullet style. </p>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text  in columns.</p>
<p> <em>Note:</em> Because  columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive technologies, consider  whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a  page break instead of repeated hard returns. </p>
<p>To insert a page break, use the shortcut Ctrl + Enter or go to the menu item <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Manual Break</strong> and select <strong>Page Break</strong> (the default option). </p>
<h3>7.5. Use a Table of  Contents</h3>
<p>Creating  an index or table of contents to outline office document content can provide a  means of navigating the meaningful sequence of content.  </p>
<p>The best way to generate a table  of contents is after applying the predefined heading styles, such as  &quot;Heading 1&quot; as described above, to the headings that you want to  include in your table of contents. After you apply these styles, you can then  create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To insert a Table of Contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select in your document where you  want to create the table of contents </li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt;  Indexes and Tables</strong> </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Index/Table </strong>tab </li>
<li>Select <strong>Table of Contents</strong> in the <strong>Type</strong> dropdown </li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h4>To use a different paragraph style as a Table  of Contents entry </h4>
<ol>
<li>Select in your document where you  want to create the table of contents </li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt;  Indexes and Tables</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Index/Table </strong>tab </li>
<li>Select <strong>Table of Contents</strong> in the <strong>Type</strong> box </li>
<li>In the <strong>Create from</strong> area, select the <strong>Additional Styles</strong> check box</li>
<li>Select the <strong>(...)</strong> button next to the check box</li>
<li>In the <strong>Assign Styles</strong> dialog, select the style in the  list</li>
<li>Select the <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> or the <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> button to define the outline  level for the paragraph style</li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a Table of Contents </h4>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Tools &gt; Update &gt; All Indexes and  Tables </strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.6 Use Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of your  document helps those reading and editing your document effectively navigate and  reference its content.  For users of  assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference within the  document.</p>
<h4>To Insert Page Numbers </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Footer</strong></li>
<li>Select the page  style that you want to add the footer to. If you have not created or applied any special page styles, “Default” will be the only option.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Fields &gt; Page Number</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="tech8" id="tech8">Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</a> </h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some audiences.  However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as possible to all members of your audience. </p>
<ul>
<li>All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts.  For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey information.
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather than colors to differentiate the bars</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the information.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a href="oowriter.html#tech9.2">Technique 9.2</a>)</li>
<li>Consider providing the data that you used to create the chart in tabular form (e.g. as an appendix).</li>
</ul>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li> Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Object &gt; Chart…</strong></li>
<li> Right-click* the chart and select <strong>Chart Data Table…</strong></li>
<li> Update the data table with the data you would like to display </li>
<li> Close the data table</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li> Select the chart </li>
<li> Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Titles</strong></li>
<li> Update the relevant fields and select <strong>OK</strong></li>
<li> Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Data Labels</strong></li>
<li> Configure your data label selections and select <strong>OK</strong>  </li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply textures to bar charts</h4>
<ol>
<li> In the chart's legend,  	right-click* on the <strong>Legend Key</strong> for one of the bars </li>
<li> Select <strong>Format Data Series...</strong></li>
<li> In the Fill area, select <strong>Hatching</strong> and choose one of the textures</li>
<li> Optionally, select the <strong>Background Color</strong> check box and choose a color.</li>
<li> Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat these steps for each legend key. </p>
<h4>To change the line style in line charts</h4>
<ol>
<li> In the line chart's legend, right-click* on the <strong>Legend Key</strong></li>
<li> Select <strong>Format Data Series...</strong></li>
<li> Select the <strong>Line</strong> tab </li>
<li> Choose a line style that will help distinguish the data series from the other lines in the chart</li>
<li> Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat these steps for each legend key. </p>
<h2><a name="tech9" id="tech9">Technique 9. Make  Content Easier to See</a></h2>
<p>Here  are some other things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When  formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.  If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Verdana, Helvetica, Arial) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond). <br />
  <em>Note:</em> Some fonts were specifically designed for easier reading on screens (e.g. the sans-serif fonts Verdana, Trebuchet MS and Calibri, and the serif fonts Georgia, Cambria and Constantia). Unfortunately, many of these fonts are not available across operating systems. </li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated (e.g., blinking) text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can&rsquo;t users just  zoom in?</strong> Office applications do typically include accessibility  features such as the ability to magnify documents and support for high contrast  modes. However, because printing is an important aspect of many workflows and  changing font sizes directly will change documents details such the pagination,  the layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a  reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong> (F11)</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from  the list</li>
<li>Right-click* and select: <strong>Modify&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select a font size under <strong>Size</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/OOWriter10.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Font tab and Size option in Paragraph Style dialog." width="555" height="461" /> </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="tech9.2" id="tech9.2"></a>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The  visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ration of  at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also,  always use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
  In  order to determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient  contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"></a><a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastAnalyser">TPG Contrast Analyser</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Relying on  Color or Sensory Characteristics </h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have edited and noting the color.  Instead, use Writer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Changes&rdquo; feature to track changes. You can find this feature in the <strong>Edit</strong> menu. </li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each image with a figure number and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Using Images of  Text</h3>
<p>Before  you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain  font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by  styling &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized  text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the  techniques noted in <a href="oowriter.html#tech3">Technique 3</a>, above.</p>
<h2><a name="tech10" id="tech10">Technique 10.  Make Content Easier to Understand</a> </h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in  a consistent way, it will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all  users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by using lots of whitespace and by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur consistently each time it is repeated.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks  are more effective navigation aids when the user understands the likely result  of following the link. Otherwise, users may have to use trial-and-error to find  what they need. To  help the user understand the result of selecting a hyperlink, ensure that the  link makes sense when read in the context of the text around it. </p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Position the cursor where you  would like to enter the link</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Hyperlinks</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Hyperlink</strong> dialog, enter the link address  in the <strong>Target </strong>box</li>
<li>In the <strong>Further settings</strong> section, enter the text to  display in the <strong>Text</strong> box</li>
<li>Select <strong>Apply</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="tech11" id="tech11">Technique 11. Check  Accessibility</a> </h2>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template (see <a href="https://adod.idrc.ocadu.ca/tech1">Technique 1</a>),  download the AccessODF extension and install it using Writer's Extension Manager (<strong>Tools &gt; Extension Manager...</strong>). This extension offers an “Accessibility Evaluation” function to review your document against a set of possible issues that users with disabilities may experience in your file.</p>
<p>AccessODF classifies issues as  either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error:</strong> content that makes a file very difficult or impossible for people with disabilities to understand or </li>
<li><strong>Warning:</strong>  content that in most, but not all, cases makes a file difficult for people with disabilities to understand.</li>
</ul>
<h3> To Use AccessODF</h3>
<ol>
<li> Go to menu item: <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility Evaluation...</strong></li>
<li> An Accessibility Evaluation task panel will open  </li>
<li>Select <strong>Check</strong> to start the evaluation<br />
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/accessODF.png" alt="Image of the AccessODF Accessibility Evaluation task panel as it appears on the side of a document that contains numerous errors." width="333" height="685" />  </li>
<li>Select a specific issue to see its description and repair suggestions.  If the <strong>Repair</strong> button becomes active, selecting this button will either repair the issue automatically or open the dialog where you can repair the issue. (For example, adding a text alternative to an image cannot be done automatically, so AccessODF opens the dialog for text alternatives.) If the issue is a false alarm, select the <strong>Ignore</strong> button.</li>
<li>When you have repaired all the issues, select the <strong>Check</strong> button again to find issues that may have gone undetected so far.</li>

<h2><a name="tech12" id="tech12"></a>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting  to Other Formats</h2>
<p>In  some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure accessibility  information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats other than the  default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible.  Accessible PDF documents are often called &ldquo;Tagged PDF&rdquo; because they include  &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that encode structural information required for accessibility.  To evaluate the accessibility of your PDF  document, see <a href="oowriter.html#tech11">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item:<strong> File &gt; Export as PDF<br />
  </strong><em>Note:</em> This option is different than the <strong>Adobe  PDF</strong> option in the <strong>Print</strong> dialog.</li>
<li>The <strong>PDF Options</strong> dialog window  opens</li>
<li>Select the <strong>General</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select the check box labeled <strong>Tagged PDF</strong> <br />
    <em>Note:</em> You must ensure this option is selected in the PDF Options window dialog box  before using PDF icon on menu bar.  This  option is not checked by default, but will remain checked once you have  selected it.</li>
<li>Select the check box labeled <strong>Export bookmarks<br />
  </strong><em>Note:</em> This creates a hierarchical list of bookmarks that link to the document&rsquo;s  headings.  This list is displayed in the  bookmarks panel of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader and facilitates navigation  (for sighted users) in large documents.</li>
<li>Optionally, select the <strong>Initial View</strong> tab; in the <strong>Panes</strong> area, select the radio button <strong>Bookmarks and page</strong></li>

<h2><a name="OtherFeatures" id="OtherFeatures">Other  Application Features</a> </h2>
<h3>Writer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Navigator&rdquo;  Feature</h3>
<p>After  you have populated your document with content and true headings have been  applied, you may wish to rearrange the content.   In order to maintain the integrity and accessibility of the altered  sequence, you will need to ensure that structural information (e.g., heading  levels) is adjusted accordingly.  </p>
<p>Writer provides a &ldquo;Navigator&rdquo;  mechanism which displays all parts of the document, such as headings, tables,  frames, objects or hyperlinks. These elements are referred to as  &ldquo;categories&rdquo;.  If a plus sign appears  next to any one of the categories, it means there is more than one object of  its kind within the document.</p>
<p>The  &ldquo;Navigator&rdquo; feature helps you navigate document content, as well as access and  manipulate the content.  This enables you  to move headings or subordinate text up or down in a document, as well as  promote or demote heading levels.   Arranging objects and other elements of the document is possible as  well, following the same principle as arranging headings and text.  This allows you to apply a meaningful  sequence that can be programmatically determined and therefore accessible to  assistive technologies.</p>
<h4>To open the &ldquo;Navigator&rdquo; </h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>View</strong> tab from the menu bar (F5)</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Navigator</strong> option</li>
