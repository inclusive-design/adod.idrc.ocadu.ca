<h2><a name="Toc58" id="Toc58">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (January 10, 2011), Excel  2007 provides a set of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the  production of accessible digital office documents. However, Excel 2007 does not  include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Office Document&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>You  should use these techniques when you are using Excel 2007 to create documents  that are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended  to be used by people</strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images,  although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully  printable</strong>(i.e.,  where dynamic features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of  contents, etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to  other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical  of office-style workflows</strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages,  applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques  will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a><strong> because these are specifically designed to provide guidance  for highly dynamic and/or interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats </h3>
<p>The  default file format for Excel 2007 is <strong>Office Open XML (XLSX)</strong>. <br />
  In  addition, Excel 2007 offers many other spreadsheet processor and web format  saving options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility, but some  information and/or instructions are available for the following formats in Technique  12 (below): </p>
<ul>
<li>MS Excel (XLS)</li>
<li>PDF </li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate  these techniques so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether  they use a mouse. However, for clarity there are several instances where  mouse-only language is used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard  alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the  Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard  have this to the right of the spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these  techniques will increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not  guarantee accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>.  In cases where more  certainty is required, it is recommended that you test the office documents  with end users with disabilities, including screen reader users. The  application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were created using  Microsoft Excel 2007 (ver.12.0.6545.5000, Windows 7, Jan. 2011) while creating  a XLSX document.  Files are also easily  saved as other file formats (see Technique 12, below). </p>
<p>This document is provided for  information purposes only and is neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of  results. If errors are found, please report them to:  <a href="mailto:adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca">adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Toc59" id="Toc59">Technique 1. Use  Accessible Templates</a> </h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template,  which can be as simple as a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly  complete document with text, graphics and other content. For example, a  &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template might include headings for information relevant to a  business meeting, such as &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and  columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p> Because templates provide the starting-point  for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a  template is accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the  template is used (see Technique 11, below). </p>
<p>Excel 2007&rsquo;s default template for new documents  is a blank page. The basic installation also includes other blank  office-related documents.  These are all  accessible by virtue of being blank. </p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible  templates from scratch in Excel 2007.  As  well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged templates, ensuring  their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an  accessible template </h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the  document (see Technique 11, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Other Formats</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type </strong>list, select <strong>Excel Template</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>File name </strong>box, type a name for the template.   Using a descriptive <strong>File name </strong>(e.g., &ldquo;Accessible Inventory Template&rdquo;) will  increase the prominence of the accessibility status.  As well, filling in the text box labeled Tags  with the term &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; will improve its searchability as an accessible  file.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an  accessible template </h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available (e.g.  that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; New</strong> </li>
<li>Under<strong> Templates</strong>, select <strong>My templates&hellip;</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Excel2007_1.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of My templates... option under Templates in the New Workbook dialog."  width="414" height="243" /></li>
<li>In the <strong>New</strong> document dialog, select your accessible template from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><strong><br />
  </strong> </li>
<li>A new document  based on the template will be displayed. If you have chosen an accessible  template, the document will be accessible at this point. <strong>As you add your  content (e.g., text, images, etc.), ensure that you consult the sections that  follow to preserve accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc60" id="Toc60">Technique 2. Set  Document Language</a> </h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able  to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural  language of the document.  If a different  natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to  be clearly indicated.<br />
<strong> </strong>At this time, it is not possible to indicate the  natural language of selected cells within an Excel 2007 workbook. [<strong>Tested: Jan 10,  2011</strong>] </p>
<h4>To change the  default language for a workbook </h4>
<ol>
<li>In the operating system, activate the keyboard layout for the language  in which you want to create and edit text</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc61" id="Toc61">Technique 3. Provide  Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p>When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is  important to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is  also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.  This can be accomplished by adding concise  alternative text to of each image. If an image is too complicated to concisely  describe in the alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a  short text alternative and a longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what       information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful       information, leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text,       ensure all of the text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short,       usually a sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g.,       for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the alternative text       (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description,       see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the document       with the images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing longer  descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when       text alternatives (see above) are insufficient to answer the question       &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information       being conveyed will be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural       detail, etc.). In these cases, try to describe the image without making       too many of your own assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are       describing the image to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise       alternative text to help readers decide if they are interested in the       longer description </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<h4>To add  alternative text to images and graphical objects </h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object </li>
<li>Select <strong>Size&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>Select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> tab </li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Alternative text</strong> box <br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Excel2007_2.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Alt Text tab, Alternative text box, and Close button in the Size and Properties dialog." width="278" height="312" /></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc62" id="Toc62"></a>Technique 4. Format Your Cells </h2>
<p>As you begin  adding content, your spreadsheet will require structuring to bring meaning to  the data, make it easier to navigate, and help assistive technologies read it  accurately.  One of the easiest ways to  do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3>4.1 Named Styles </h3>
<p>You should make use of the named styles that  are included with the office application (e.g., &ldquo;Heading&rdquo;, &ldquo;Result&rdquo;, etc.)  before creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools  directly.  Named styles help your readers  understand why something was formatted in a given way, which is especially  helpful when there are multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is  common to use italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names). For more information on formatting using  named styles, see Technique 9.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites  support headings in much the same way, the named styles often differ. </p>
<p>Formatting  header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet and makes it easier for  users to navigate effectively.   For  example, you can format header rows and columns using &ldquo;Heading&rdquo; styles to apply  bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics).  You may also want to format cells containing  results of calculations to appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them  from the rest of your data.</p>
<h4>To format a cell with default named styles </h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format<br />
  <em>Note:</em> to apply a style to an entire row or column,  select the row or column indicator and follow the next steps</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the <strong>Cell Styles</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the desired formatting style from the drop-down menu<br />
  <em>Note:</em> To modify a style, right-click* the desired  formatting style from the drop-down menu and select <strong>Modify</strong>.  Changes  made to the style will affect all instances of the style within your workbook.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4.2 Other Cell Characteristics </h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly  represent your data, including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell characteristics </h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong> </li>
<li>In the relevant sections (e.g. <strong>Numbers</strong>, <strong>Font</strong>, etc.) make your adjustments<br />
  <em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to  avoid merging cells.  At times, it may  seem easier to present your data by merging cells, but this can make it more  difficult for users of assistive technologies and people navigating your  spreadsheet using the keyboard. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc63" id="Toc63"></a>Technique 5. Use Cell  Addressing </h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc278376938" id="_Toc278376938">5.1 Define Names</a> </h3>
<p>Naming the  different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it easier to navigate  through the document and find specific information.  By associating a meaningful name to a data  range, you will be enhancing the readability of your document.  These named ranges can be referenced in  multiple locations of your document and within calculations and equations.</p>
<h4>To define a name </h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells you would like to name</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Formulas</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Defined Names</strong> section, select the <strong>Define Name</strong> button</li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> text box, enter the name for the data range</li>
<li>In the <strong>Scope</strong> drop-down list, select scope within which the name can be referenced</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/MSExcel2010_7.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Name box and Scope option in New Name dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc64" id="Toc64"></a>Technique 6. Create  Accessible Charts </h2>
<p>Spreadsheet  applications support various types of charts, which can be used to display your  spreadsheet data in meaningful ways for your audience.  It is important to ensure that your chart is as  accessible as possible to all members of your audience.  All basic accessibility considerations that  are applied to the rest of your document must also be applied to your charts  and the elements within your charts.  For  example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey  information.  As well, some further steps  should be taken to ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate  labeled to give users reference points that will help to correctly interpret  the information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the data that you  want to include in the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Charts </strong>section, select the icon of the  type of chart you would like to insert</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart  Type</strong> from the <strong>Chart  Gallery</strong> in the drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart  Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu  item: <strong>Layout</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Labels </strong>section, select the type of title  or label you would like to define (e.g., <strong>Chart Title, Axis Titles, Data Labels</strong>)<br />
  <em>Note:</em> It is  a good idea to use as many of the titles and labels available in this section  as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a predefined chart  layout</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart  Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu  item: <strong>Design</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart  Layouts</strong> section, select a <strong>Quick  Layout</strong> from the scrolling <strong>Chart  Layouts</strong> gallery</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different predefined  chart type</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart  Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu  item: <strong>Design</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Type</strong> section, select the <strong>Change Chart Type</strong> icon</li>
<li>In the <strong>Change  Chart Type</strong> dialog, select a chart  type from the left pane</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart  Design</strong> from the right pane</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts,  use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to  facilitate legibility for users who are color blind</li>
<li>Change the default colors  to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options  to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast  requirements (see Other Considerations, below) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Toc65" id="Toc65">Technique 7. Provide Structure for Tables</a></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Excel 2007 includes an &ldquo;Insert  Table&rdquo; feature but this works by applying cell formatting to spreadsheet cells.  As such, it is not a structural feature in the same way that tables are in Word  2010 and PowerPoint 2010.</p>
<h2> <a name="Toc66" id="Toc66">Technique 8. Use Other  Content Structuring Features</a></h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the  most common method of structuring documents, other content structuring features  should be used where appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p>In  case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given a descriptive  and meaningful title. </p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to  menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Prepare &gt; Properties</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Document  Properties</strong> section that appears, select the <strong>Title </strong>text box </li>
<li>Enter the <strong>Title</strong><strong><br />
  </strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the properties is different than the  file name. It is also unrelated to the template name, discussed above. </li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Avoid &ldquo;Floating&rdquo; Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid &quot;floating&quot;  elements such as floating images, objects, tables or text boxes.<br />
  Similarly, avoid placing  drawing objects directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create a  diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert complete  graphical objects.</p>
<h2><a name="Toc67" id="Toc67">Technique 9. Make  Content Easier to See</a> </h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When  formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for       cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than       bold or light weight fonts.  If you       do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing       and easily recognized upper and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g.,       Arial, Verdana) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g.,       Times New Roman, Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in       caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character       spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can&rsquo;t users just  zoom in?</strong>Office applications do typically include  accessibility features such as the ability to magnify documents and support for  high contrast modes. However, because printing is an important aspect of many  workflows and changing font sizes directly will change documents details such  the pagination, the layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to always  format text for a reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the  text size for a default named style </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to  menu item: <strong>Home</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the <strong>Cell Styles </strong>icon</li>
<li>Select  the style to modify from the list</li>
<li>Right-click*  and select: <strong>Modify&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Style </strong>dialog,  select the <strong>Format</strong> button<br />
      <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/MSExcel2010_8.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Format button in Style dialog." />
  </li>
<li>In the <strong>Format Cells</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Font </strong>tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Size</strong> text  box, type the desired size or select it from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
      <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/MSExcel2010_9.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Font tab and Size option in Format Cells dialog." /></strong>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The  visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ration of  at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also,  always use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
  In  order to determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient  contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast  Ratio Analyzer</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone </h3>
<p>Color  should not be used as the only visual means of conveying information,  indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual  element.  In order to spot where color  might be the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a  screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale converting  tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit  v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have       edited and noting the color. Instead use Google docs: Spreadsheet&rsquo;s review       functionality features to track changes, such as revision history.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance       (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each image with a figure number       and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you  use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain  font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by  styling &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized  text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the  techniques noted above.</p>
<h2><a name="Toc68" id="Toc68">Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</a> </h2>
<h3>10.1  Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it will  be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with       short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out       abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by       using lots of whitespace and by avoiding too many different colors, fonts       and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple       pages within a document or within a set of documents (e.g., headings,       footings, etc.), it should occur consistently each time it is repeated.  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc273696206" id="_Toc273696206">10.2 Navigational Instructions</a></h3>
<p>Provide a  general description of the spreadsheet contents and instructions on how to  navigate the data effectively.  The best  way to do this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with  this information.  It will be the first  cell accessed by assistive technologies.   If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can attach a comment  note to the cell containing navigational instructions.</p>
<h2><a name="Toc69" id="Toc69">Technique 11.  Check Accessibility</a> </h2>
<p>At  this time, Excel 2007 does not offer a mechanism to check for potential  accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.  <strong>[Tested: January 10th, 2011]</strong><br />
  In  order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document or template  (see Technique 1), then you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in  order to perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described  below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML  accessibility</h4>
<p>Another  option is to save the document into HTML format and use one of the web  accessibility checkers available online.   Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM  Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF  accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF  format, you can use the following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility  of the PDF document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Acrobat  Professional</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pac-pdf-accessibility-checker.html">PDF  Accessibility Checker (PAC) </a> &ndash; a free alternative provided  by &ldquo;Access for all&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Advanced  &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full Check&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Full  Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking option</li>
<li>Select  the <strong>Start  Checking</strong> button </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Toc70" id="Toc70">Technique 12.  Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to Other Formats</a> </h2>
<p>In  some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure accessibility  information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats other than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>PDF documents are not always accessible.  Accessible PDF documents are often called &ldquo;Tagged PDF&rdquo; because they include  &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that encode structural information required for accessibility.  To evaluate the accessibility of your PDF  document, see Technique 11 (above).</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item:<strong> Office &gt; Save As &gt; PDF or XPS</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name </strong>box,  type a name for the file</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> button</li>
<li>Under <strong>Include non-printing information</strong> in  the <strong>Options</strong> dialog, ensure that the <strong>Document  structure tags for accessibility</strong> check box is  selected</li>
<li>Under <strong>PDF options</strong>,  ensure that <strong>Bitmap  text when fonts may not be embedded</strong> check box is de-selected</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Save</strong><br />
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Word2007_9.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Document structure tags for accessibility option and Bitmap text when fonts may not be embedded option in Options dialog." width="220" height="323" /></li>
</ol>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Other Formats</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select <strong>Web  Page</strong> </li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong> </li>
<li>Check the HTML file for  accessibility (see Technique 11, above)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove  unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove  unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove  font tags</li>
<li>Remove  styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure  the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove  &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt; tags</li>
<li>Check  for accessibility (see Technique 11, above)<br />
  <em>Note:</em> you  may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help with this process.</li>
</ul>
