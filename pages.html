<h2><a name="_Toc284512489" id="_Toc284512489">Usage  Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (September 30, 2010), Pages  &lsquo;09 lacks several features that enable accessible office document authoring,  most notably: the ability to add alternative text to image and objects. As a  result, some of the other features that might otherwise support accessibility,  such as its extensive templates are not as effective. In addition, Pages &lsquo;09  does not include an accessibility checking feature. </p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Office Document&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>You  should use these techniques when you are using Pages &lsquo;09 to create documents  that are: </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Intended  to be used by people </strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li> <strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images,  although they may contain images),</li>
<li> <strong>Fully  printable </strong>(i.e.,  where dynamic features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of  contents, etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to  other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li> <strong>Typical  of office-style workflows </strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>If you are creating  forms, web pages, applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content,  these techniques will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"> <strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong> because these are specifically designed to provide guidance  for highly dynamic and/or interactive content. </strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The  default file format for Pages &lsquo;09 is the native  <strong>iWork format</strong>. <br />
  In  addition, Pages &lsquo;09 offers many other word processor and web format saving  options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility, but some  information and/or instructions are available for the following formats in <a href="pages.html#_Toc284342222">Technique  12</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Word </li>
<li>PDF </li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3> Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate  these techniques so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether  they use a mouse. However, for clarity there are several instances where  mouse-only language is used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard  alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the  Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard  have this to the right of the spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Disclaimer and Testing  Details:</h3>
<p> <strong>Following these  techniques will increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not  guarantee accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>.  In cases where more  certainty is required, it is recommended that you test the office documents  with end users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The  application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were created using iWork  Pages &lsquo;09 (ver.4.0.3 (766), Mac OS X, Sept. 2010) while producing a document in the native iWork file format.  Files are also easily saved as other file  formats (see<a href="pages.html#_Toc284342222">Technique  12</a>).</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512490" id="_Toc284512490">Technique 1</a>. Use Accessible Templates </h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template,  which can be as simple as a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly  complete document with text, graphics and other content. For example, a  &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template might include headings for information relevant to a  business meeting, such as &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and  columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point  for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a  template is accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the  template is used (see <a href="pages.html#_Toc284342221">Technique 11</a>). </p>
<p>The default template for new documents in  Pages &lsquo;09 is a blank page. The basic installation also includes blank letter  templates and blank business reports.  These  are all accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible  templates from scratch in Pages &lsquo;09.  As  well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged templates, ensuring  their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible  template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>File &gt; New</strong> or  <strong>File &gt; New from Template Chooser&hellip; </strong>(Shift+Apple+N) </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Template Chooser</strong> dialog, select the  <strong>Blank template </strong>or select one of the other  existing template designs</li>
<li>A new document in your selected  template style will open</li>
<li>Ensure that you  follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished  you should also check the accessibility of the document (See Accessibility  Checking, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>File &gt; Save as Template&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Export As</strong> box, type a name for the template.  Using a descriptive template name (e.g.  &ldquo;Accessible Memo Template&rdquo;) will increase the prominence of the accessibility  status.</li>
<li>Specify a folder in which to save  your template.  To save the template in a  different location than the default, create a new folder in the  <strong>Templates </strong>folder.  The folder name is then used as a template  category in the  <strong>Template  Chooser</strong>.<br />
    Note: By default, it will be saved in your home folder in  Library/Application Support/iWork/Pages/Templates/My Templates pane of the  <strong>Template Chooser</strong>.
<p>

    </p>
</li>
<li>Click  <strong>Save</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible  template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available (e.g.  that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>File &gt; New from Template Chooser&hellip; </strong>(Shift+Apple+N) </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Template Chooser</strong> dialog, select  <strong>My  Templates</strong> from the left pane
<p>
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Pages09_2.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of template icon in the Template Chooser dialog." width="282" height="279" />
  </p>
</li>
<li>Select your  accessible template and click  <strong>Choose</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512491" id="_Toc284512491">Technique 2. Specify  Document Language</a> </h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able  to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural  language of the document.  If a different  natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to  be clearly indicated.</p>
<h4>To apply a language  directly to selected text </h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text<br />
  Note: To change the language of  the entire document, do a select all to select all the text in the document.</li>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>View  &gt; Show Inspector</strong> </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select the  <strong>Text</strong> button</li>
<li>In the  <strong>Text</strong> section, click the  <strong>More</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the  <strong>Language</strong> section, select the language from the drop-down list
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Pages09_3.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Text button, More tab, and Language section in the Inspector dialog." width="159" height="373" />
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512492" id="_Toc284512492">Technique 3.  Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p><strong>  </strong>At this time, Pages  &rsquo;09 does not offer a mechanism which enables the user to add alternative text  descriptions to images or objects.  <strong>[Tested:  September 28, 2010]</strong> </p>
<p>When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is  important to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is  also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.  This can be accomplished by adding concise  alternative text to each image. If an image is too complicated to concisely  describe in the alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a  short text alternative and a longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what       information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful       information, leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text,       ensure all of the text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short,       usually a sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g.,       for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the alternative text       (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description,       see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the       document with the images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing longer  descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when       text alternatives (see above) are insufficient to answer the question       &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information       being conveyed will be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural       detail, etc.). In these cases, try to describe the image without making       too many of your own assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are       describing the image to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise       alternative text to help readers decide if they are interested in the       longer description </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512493" id="_Toc284512493">Technique 4.  Avoid &ldquo;Floating&rdquo; Elements</a> </h2>
<p>Pages  &rsquo;09 will default the position of an inserted image or object depending on the  method that is used to insert it.  If you  use a method that requires you to simply drag-and-drop the image or object onto  the document, it will automatically be positioned as &ldquo;floating&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A  &ldquo;floating&rdquo; object keeps its position relative to the page, while text flows  around it.  As content moves up or down  on the page, the object stays where it was placed.  To ensure that images and objects remain with  the text that references it, press the Command key and then drag the image onto  the document or follow the steps below.</p>
<h4> To  import image as an inline object </h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the insertion point  wherever you want the image to appear</li>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>Insert &gt; Choose</strong> </li>
<li>Select the image file</li>
<li>Click  <strong>Insert</strong> <br />
  Note: You can always ensure your image or object is positioned with the  text that references it.  Select the  image or object, then go to the  <strong>Format</strong> bar and ensure that  <strong>Inline</strong> button is selected.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512494" id="_Toc284512494">Technique 5. Use  Headings</a> </h2>
<p>Any  documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require structuring to make  them more straightforward for readers to understand.  <strong>One of the easiest ways to do this is  to use &ldquo;true headings&rdquo; to </strong>create logical  divisions between paragraphs. True headings are more than just bolded,  enlarged, or centered text; they are structural elements that order and levels  provide a meaningful sequence to users of assistive technologies.</p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for headings</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use the default headings styles provided       (&ldquo;Heading &ldquo;, &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo;, etc.)</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the       sub-headings of a &ldquo;Heading 1&rdquo; are &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo;, etc.)</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<h4>To apply headings to selected text</h4>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Highlight selected  text</li>
<li>Go to the  <strong>Format Bar</strong> and select the  <strong>Choose  a paragraph style</strong> button</li>
<li>Select the style you  would like to apply from the drop-down menu
<p>
  <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Pages09_4.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of headings drop-down menu in the Format bar." width="145" height="305" />
  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>To create new heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight text and  format with the characteristics you would like to apply to a new heading</li>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>Format &gt; Create New Paragraph Style  from Selection&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the  <strong>New paragraph style</strong> dialog, enter a heading style name in the  <strong>Name</strong> text box</li>
<li>Select  <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512495" id="_Toc284512495">Technique 6. Use Named Styles</a></h2>
<p>As with &ldquo;True Headings&rdquo; (see  <a href="pages.html#_Toc284512494">Technique 5</a>), you should attempt to make use of the named styles that are  included with the office application (e.g., &ldquo;emphasis&rdquo;, &ldquo;caption&rdquo;, etc.) before  creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly.  Named styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a  given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons for the  same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis, Latin terms  and species names).</p>
<p>For more information on  formatting using named styles, see <a href="pages.html#_Toc284512498">Technique 9</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in much the same  way, the named styles often differ. </p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Default named styles can be applied the       same way as headings (see <a href="pages.html#_Toc284512494">Technique 5</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512496" id="_Toc284512496">Technique 7. Use Built-In Document  Structuring Features</a></h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is  important to ensure that they are clear and appropriately structured. This  helps all users to better understand the information in the table and allows  assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to provide context so that the  information within the table can be conveyed in a meaningful way. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Only use tables for tabular information,       not for formatting, such as to position columns.</li>
<li>Use &ldquo;real tables&rdquo; rather than text       formatted to look like tables using the TAB key or space bar. These will       not be recognized by assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged       cells and dividing complex data sets into separate smaller tables, where       possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the       header to show at the top of each page. Also set the table to break       between rows instead of in the middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text  summary of the essential table contents. Any abbreviations used should be  explained in the summary. </li>
<li>Table       captions or descriptions should answer the question &quot;what is the       table's purpose and how is it organized?&quot; (e.g., &quot;A sample order       form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity&quot;).  </li>
<li>Table       cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as labels to help       interpret the other cells in the table. </li>
<li>Table       header cell labels should be concise and clear. </li>
<li>Ensure       the table is not &ldquo;floating&rdquo; on the page (see <a href="pages.html#_Toc284512493">Technique 4</a>) </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Position the cursor at the  location in the document you would like to add the table</li>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>Insert &gt; Table</strong> </li>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector</strong> </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select  <strong>Table inspector</strong> </li>
<li>Select the  <strong>Table</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the  <strong>Headers &amp; Footer</strong> section, click the  <strong>Choose the number of header columns</strong> button or the  <strong>Choose the number of header rows</strong> button</li>
<li>Select the number of header rows  or columns you would like your table to have
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Pages09_5.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Table inspector, Table tab, and Headers &amp; Footer section in the Inspector dialog." width="203" height="146" />
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2. Lists</h3>
</p><p>When  you create lists, it is important to format them as &ldquo;real lists&rdquo;. Otherwise,  assistive technologies will interpret your list as a series of short separate  paragraphs instead of a coherent list of related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor where you would  like to insert the list or highlight the text of a list you already entered  into your document</li>
<li>In the  <strong>Toolbar</strong>, click the  <strong>Inspector </strong>button to show the inspector  window</li>
<li>In the  <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, click the  <strong>Text inspector</strong> button</li>
<li>Select the  <strong>List</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the  <strong>Bullets &amp; Numbering</strong> section, format your list style  using the drop-down menus
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use  <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text  in columns. <br />
    <em>Note:</em> Because  columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive technologies, consider  whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a  page break instead of repeated hard returns.</p>
<h3>7.5 Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating  an index or table of contents to outline office document content can provide a  means of navigating the meaningful sequence of content.  </p>
<p>The best way to generate a table  of contents is after applying the predefined heading styles, such as  &quot;Heading 1&quot; as described above, to the headings that you want to  include in your table of contents. After you apply these styles, you can then  create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To generate a Table of Contents </h4>
<ol>
<li>In the  <strong>Toolbar</strong>,  click  <strong>Inspector</strong> </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, click the  <strong>Document</strong> button</li>
<li>Select  the  <strong>TOC</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select  the checkboxes next to the paragraph styles whose text you want to appear in  the table of contents</li>
<li>In the  <strong>#&rsquo;s</strong> column, select those paragraph styles for which you want page numbers to appear
<p>
      <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Pages09_7.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Document button, TOC tab, and list of paragraph styles in the Inspector dialog." width="166" height="295" />
    </p>
</li>
<li>Place  the insertion point at the beginning of the line where you want the table of  contents to appear<br />
  Note: Table of contents created in Pages &rsquo;09 list only the content that  follows it, up until the next table of contents.  To create a master table of all the contents  in your document, it must be the only table of contents and must be placed at  the beginning of the document. </li>
<li>Go to  menu item:  <strong>Insert  &gt; Table of Contents </strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a Table of Contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the  <strong>Toolbar</strong>, click  <strong>Inspector</strong> </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, click the  <strong>Document</strong> button</li>
<li>Select the  <strong>TOC</strong> tab</li>
<li>Click  <strong>Update Now</strong> at the bottom of the dialog<br />
  Note: You can also automatically update by clicking any entry in the  table of contents.</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.6 Use Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of your  document helps those reading and editing your document effectively navigate and  reference its content.</p>
<h4>To Insert Page  Numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item:  <strong>Insert &gt; Auto Page Numbers&hellip; </strong></li>
<li>In the  <strong>Insert Page Numbers</strong> dialog,  format the page number using the available options</li>
<li>Select  <strong>Insert </strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>In  case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given a descriptive  and meaningful title.  </p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document </h4>
<ol>

<h2><a name="_Toc278376940" id="_Toc278376940">Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</a> </h2>
<p> Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some audiences.  However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as possible to all members of your audience.  All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts.  For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey information.  As well, some further steps should be taken to ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the information. </p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to  menu item:  <strong>Insert  &gt; Chart</strong> </li>
<li>Select  a chart type from the list</li>
<li>Update  the  <strong>Chart Data  Editor</strong> with the data you would like to display in  the chart</li>
<li>Close  the  <strong>Chart Data  Editor</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector</strong> </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Chart Inspector</strong>, select  <strong>Chart</strong> </li>
<li>Ensure the  <strong>Show Title</strong> and  <strong>Show  Legend</strong> check boxes are selected</li>
<li>Select  <strong>Axis</strong> </li>
<li>Under  <strong>Value Axis (Y)</strong> and  <strong>Category  Axis (X)</strong>, select  <strong>Show Title</strong> and  <strong>Show  Value Labels</strong> from their respective  drop-down menus</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different  predefined Chart Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector</strong> </li>
<li>Select a chart type from  the  <strong>Choose a chart  type</strong> drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts,  use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to  facilitate legibility for users who are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts,  it is helpful to apply texture instead of color to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors  to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options  to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast  requirements (see <a href="pages.html#tech9.2">Technique 9.2</a>) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512498" id="_Toc284512498">Technique 9. Make  Content Easier to See</a> </h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When  formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for       body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than       bold or light weight fonts.  If you       do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing       and easily recognized upper and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts       (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts       (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in       caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character       spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But  can&rsquo;t users just zoom in?</strong>  Office  applications do typically include accessibility features such as the ability to  magnify documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because  printing is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes  directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout of  tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a reasonable degree  of accessibility.</p>
<h3><a name="tech9.2"></a>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The  visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ration of  at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black,       Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast       (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast       (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also,  always use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
  In  order to determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient  contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast  Ratio Analyzer</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc273692193" id="_Toc273692193">9.3 Avoid Using  Color Alone</a> </h3>
<p>Color  should not be used as the only visual means of conveying information,  indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual  element.  In order to spot where color  might be the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a  screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale converting  tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit  v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on  Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing       the color of text you have edited and noting the color. Instead use Pages       &rsquo;09 &ldquo;Change Tracking&rdquo; functionality to track changes. <strong>  </strong></li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by       referring to their appearance (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each       image with a figure number and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before  you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain  font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by  styling &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized  text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the steps  noted in <a href="pages.html#_Toc284512492">Technique 3</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284512499" id="_Toc284512499">Technique 10.  Make Content Easier to Understand</a> </h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in  a consistent way, it will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all  users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever possible, write       clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and       spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document       too &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by using lots of whitespace and by avoiding too many different       colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on       multiple pages within a document or within a set of documents (e.g.,       headings, footings, etc.), it should occur consistently each time it is       repeated.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks  are more effective navigation aids when the user understands the likely result  of following the link. Otherwise, users may have to use trial-and-error to find  what they need.</p>
<p>To  help the user understand the result of selecting a hyperlink, ensure that the  link makes sense when read in the context of the text around it. For example,  while it would be confusing to use &ldquo;more information&rdquo; as a link by itself on a  page, it would be fine to use &ldquo;more information&rdquo; as a link in the following  sentence: &ldquo;The airport can be reached by taxi or bus (<u>more information</u>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  make the address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the  address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the  <strong>Toolbar</strong>, click Inspector</li>
<li>Click the  <strong>Link inspector</strong> button</li>
<li>Select the  <strong>Hyperlink</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select the  <strong>Make all hyperlinks inactive</strong> checkbox
<p>

<li>Edit the hyperlink text<br />
    <em>Note:</em> While  editing the hyperlink text, you have deactivated all hyperlinks in the  document.  To reactive the hyperlinks,  deselect the  <strong>Make  all hyperlinks inactive</strong> checkbox.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284342221" id="_Toc284342221">Technique 11. Check  Accessibility</a> </h2>
<p><strong>  </strong>At this time, Pages  &rsquo;09 does not offer a mechanism to check for potential accessibility errors in  your document prior to publishing. As well, it is not currently possible to  export Pages &rsquo;09 documents as HTML.  <strong>[Tested: September 30th, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>In  order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document or template  (see <a href="pages.html#_Toc284512490">Technique 1</a>), then you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in  order to perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described  below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Save  the document into HTML format and use one of the web accessibility checkers  available online.  Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">A Checker</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM  Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF  accessibility</h4>
<p>If  you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the following tools  and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Acrobat  Professional</li>
<li><a href="http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pac-pdf-accessibility-checker.html">PDF Accessibility Checker (PAC)</a> &ndash;  a free alternative provided by &ldquo;Access for all&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF  accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full  Check&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the  <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking option</li>
<li>Select the  <strong>Start Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284342222" id="_Toc284342222">Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when  Saving/Exporting to Other Formats</a> </h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken  in order to ensure accessibility information is preserved when exporting to  formats other than the default.</p>
<p>At  this time, it is not possible to export Pages &rsquo;09 documents as HTML files.  <strong>[Tested: September 28, 2010]</strong></p>
<h3>PDF, Word, RTF, or plain  text</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>PDF documents are not always accessible.  Accessible PDF documents are often called &ldquo;Tagged PDF&rdquo; because they include  &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that encode structural information required for accessibility.  To evaluate the accessibility of your PDF  document, see <a href="pages.html#_Toc284342221">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item:  <strong>File &gt; Export</strong></li>
<li>Select the type  of format you would like to export, click  <strong>Next</strong></li>
<li>In the  <strong>Save A</strong>s box, type a name for the  document</li>
<li>Choose where you  want to save the document</li>
<li>Click  <strong>Export<br />
  </strong>Note: Exporting  a plain text file removes all formatting.   Pages documents may not export identically in Word, due to text layout  differences.</li>
