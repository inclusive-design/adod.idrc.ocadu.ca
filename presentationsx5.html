<h2><a name="_Toc279394416" id="_Toc279394416">Usage Notes</a></h2>
<p>At the time of testing (September 20, 2010), Presentations  X5 lacks several features that enable accessible office document authoring,  most notably: the ability to add alternative text to images and objects, the  ability to create your own accessible templates, indicate natural language for  selected text, quick styles or named styles, edit hyperlink text, and change  tracking. As a result, some of the other features that might otherwise support  accessibility, such as its extensive templates are not as effective. In  addition, Presentations X5 does not include an accessibility checking feature,  which is a more advanced accessibility feature.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Office Document&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>You  should use these techniques when you are using Presentations X5 to create  documents that are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended  to be used by people </strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images,  although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully  printable </strong>(i.e.,  where dynamic features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of  contents, etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to  other documents, unlike web content), and </li>
<li><strong>Typical  of office-style workflows </strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating  forms, web pages, applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content,  these techniques will still be useful to you, but you should also consult the </strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a><strong> because these are specifically designed to provide guidance  for highly dynamic and/or interactive content. </strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The  default file format for Presentations X5 is <strong>Presentations Slide Show (SHW)</strong>. <br />
  In  addition, Presentations X5 offers many other presentation processor and web  format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility,  but some information and/or instructions are available for the following  formats in <a href="presentationsx5.html#_Toc284333461">Technique 12</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>MS PowerPoint (PPT)</li>
<li>PDF </li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate  these techniques so that they are useful to all authors, regardless of whether  they use a mouse. However, for clarity there are several instances where mouse-only  language is used. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard  alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the  Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the &ldquo;Right-Click&rdquo; key (some keyboard  have this to the right of the spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing  Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these  techniques will increase the accessibility of your documents, but it does not  guarantee accessibility to any specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty  is required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end  users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The  application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were created using  Corel Presentations X5 (ver. 15.0.0.357, Windows XP, Sept. 2010) while creating  a document in Presentation Slide Show format. Files are also easily saved as other file formats (see <a href="presentationsx5.html#_Toc284333461">Technique 12</a>).</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284508113" id="_Toc284508113">Technique 1. Use  Accessible Templates</a> </h2>
<p>At this time, it is not possible to create your own accessible templates  in Presentations X5. <strong>[Tested September 15th, 2010]</strong> When using the pre-existing templates it is  important to ensure that you modify any inaccessible aspects of the template  while editing in your document.</p>
<p>All office documents start with a template,  which can be as simple as a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly  complete document with text, graphics and other content. For example, a  &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo; template might include headings for information relevant to a  business meeting, such as &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; above a table with rows to denote time and  columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point  for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a  template is accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the  template is used (see<a href="presentationsx5.html#_Toc284333460"> Technique 11</a>). </p>
<p>Presentation X5&rsquo;s default template for new documents  is a blank presentation. If you are  connected to the internet, you can access a variety of blank business presentation  templates. These are all accessible by  virtue of being blank. As well, you may create your own templates. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284508114" id="_Toc284508114">Technique 2. Set  Document Language</a> </h2>
<p>At  this time, it is not possible to indicate the natural language for selected  text in Presentations X5. <strong>[Tested  September 15th, 2010]</strong> </p>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able  to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the natural  language of the document. If a different  natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to  be clearly indicated.</p>
<h4>To change the default language  for the document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools  &gt; Thesaurus</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Writing  Tools </strong>dialog, select <strong>Options</strong>
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/PresentationsX5_1.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Options button in Writing Tools dialog." width="393" height="170" />
    </p>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Language&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Select  Language </strong>dialog, select a language from  the scrolling list</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>  >
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/PresentationsX5_2.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Language list and Save as default Writing Tools language check box in Select Language dialog." width="287" height="191" />
    </p>
</li>
<li>In the <strong>Writing  Tools </strong>dialog, click <strong>Close</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284508115" id="_Toc284508115">Technique 3. Use  Built-In Layout and Styling Features</a> </h2>
<p>Presentations X5 does not provide "True Headings" or "Named Styles" as does WordPerfect X5.</p>
<h3><a name="tech3.1"></a>3.1 Use Built-In Slide  Layouts</h3>
<p>Instead  of creating each slide in your presentation by starting from a blank slide,  check whether there is a suitable built-in layout. </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The built-in layouts can be more accessible to users of assistive technologies  because they technologies sometimes read the floating items on the slide in the  order that they were placed on the slide. The built-in layouts have usually  taken this into account (e.g., &ldquo;Title&rdquo; first followed by other items, left to  right and from top to bottom). If you create slide layouts from scratch, it is  sometimes difficult to keep track of the order elements were placed.</p>
<h4>To apply &ldquo;true layout&rdquo; to a slide </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Layout Gallery</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Slide Properties</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Appearance</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Layouts</strong> section, select a layout from the layout icons</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/PresentationsX5_3.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Layouts section in Slide Properties dialog." width="359" height="299" />
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Customize Using Master Slides</h3>
<p>If a layout must be customized,  it is recommended that Master Slides be used.<br />
  Every slide layout in a  presentation is defined by its master slide. A master slide determines the formatting style for various elements of  the slide layout. This includes font  styles, character formatting, and the positioning of elements. Essentially, each master slide acts as a  design template for the slide layout. <br />
If you edit any aspect of the  slide layout in the master slide, the change will affect all slides that were  created based on it. For this reason, it  is good practice to edit the master slide and use the slide layouts before  building individual slides. It is essential  that you create and use master slides that meet the accessibility requirements  outlined in this document.</p>
<h4>To create or customize a master slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Master gallery</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Category</strong> list box, select a slide  show category</li>
<li>Select a master  from the scrolling gallery</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/PresentationsX5_6.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Category option and scrolling gallery in Master Gallery dialog." width="393" height="279" />
    </p>
</li>
<li>Your selected  master slide appears</li>
<li>Customize the  master slide to suit your needs (e.g., apply a design, theme-based colors,  fonts, effects, backgrounds) ensuring that your changes meet accessibility  requirements<br />
  Note: To  create your own master slide from scratch by customizing a master slide from  the default blank presentation, follow the next step.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save in</strong> list box, choose <strong>X:\Program&nbsp;Files\Corel\WordPerfect&nbsp;Office&nbsp;X5\Languages\EN\Masters<br />
  </strong>Note: &ldquo;X&rdquo;  represents the drive on which Presentations X5 is stored.</li>
<li>Double-click the  relevant <strong>Master</strong> category folder</li>
<li>In the <strong>File type</strong> list box, select either <strong>Presentations Master 3.0</strong> or <strong>Presentations Master 7-X5</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Filename</strong> box, type a file name<br />
  Note:  Including the term &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; in the file name will promote its status as an  accessible master slide.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/PresentationsX5_7.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Save in option, File name box, and File type optoin in Save As dialog." width="459" height="347" />
    </p>
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284333453" id="_Toc284333453">Technique 4. Set a Logical Tab Order</a></h2>
<p>Many presentation applications  create content composed almost exclusively of &quot;floating&quot; objects.  This means that they avoid the transitions between in-line content and  secondary &quot;floating&quot; objects (text boxes, images, etc.) that can cause  accessibility issues in word processors.</p>
<p>However, when you are working with &quot;floating&quot; objects, it is  important to remember that the way objects are positioned in two dimensions on  the screen may be completely different from how the objects will be read by a  screen reader or navigated using a keyboard. The order that content is  navigated sequentially is called the &quot;Tab Order&quot; because often the  &quot;Tab&quot; key is used to navigate from one &quot;floating&quot; object to  the next.  </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for setting a logical &ldquo;tab order&rdquo; for  &quot;floating&quot; objects</h3>
<ul>
<li>The tab order of floating objects is usually from the &ldquo;lowest&rdquo; object on  the slide to the &ldquo;highest&rdquo;. </li>
<li>Because objects automatically appear &ldquo;on top&rdquo; when they are inserted,  the default tab order is from the first object inserted to the last. However,  this will change if you use features such as &ldquo;bring to front&rdquo; and &ldquo;send to  back&rdquo;. </li>
<li>The slide&rsquo;s main heading should be first in the tab order.</li>
<li>Headings should be placed in the tab order immediately before the items  (text, diagrams, etc.) for which they are acting as a heading.</li>
<li>Labels should be in the reading order placed immediately before the  objects that they label.</li>
<li>For simple slide layouts, it may be possible to simply insert objects in  a logical tab order.</li>
<li>For more complex layouts, it may be easier to simply to create the slide  as usual and then set the tab order (see below).</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<h4>To set the tab order</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the object</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Edit &gt; Arrange &gt; Order &gt; To  Front</strong>, <strong>To  Back</strong>, <strong>Forward  One</strong>, or <strong>Back  One</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284508117" id="_Toc284508117">Technique 5. Use  Slide Notes</a> </h2>
</p><p>A useful aspect of presentation  applications is the facility to add notes to slides, which can then be read by  assistive technologies. You can use  these slide notes to explain and expand on the contents of your slides in text  format. Slide notes can be created as  you build your presentation.</p>
<h4>To add notes to your slides</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Slide properties &gt;  Speaker notes</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Slide Properties</strong> dialog, enter text in the box to accompany the slide</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc284508118" id="_Toc284508118">Technique 6.  Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical Objects</a> </h2>
<p>At this time, it is  not possible to add alternative text or longer descriptions to images and  graphical objects inserted into Presentations X5 documents. <strong>[Tested September 15th, 2010] </strong></p>
<p>When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and graphs, it is  important to ensure that the information you intend to convey by the image is  also conveyed to people who cannot see the image. This can be accomplished by adding concise  alternative text of each image. If an image is too complicated to concisely  describe in the alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a  short text alternative and a longer description as well. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for writing  alternative text</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Try to answer the question &quot;what       information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful       information, leave the alternative text blank </li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text,       ensure all of the text is replicated </li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short,       usually a sentence or less and rarely more than two sentences </li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g.,       for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the alternative text       (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in the long description,       see below </li>
<li>Test by having others review the document       with the images replaced by the alternative text </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Long descriptions should be used when       text alternatives (see above) are insufficient to answer the question       &quot;what information is the image conveying?&quot; </li>
<li>In some situations, the information       being conveyed will be how an image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural       detail, etc.). In these cases, try to describe the image without making       too many of your own assumptions. </li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are       describing the image to a person over the phone </li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise       alternative text to help readers decide if they are interested in the       longer description </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively,  you can include the same information conveyed by the image within the body of  the document, providing the images as an alternate to the text. In that case,  you do not have to provide alternate text within the image.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284508119" id="_Toc284508119">Technique 7. Use Built-In Structuring  Features</a></h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is  important to ensure that they are clear and appropriately structured. This  helps all users to better understand the information in the table and allows  assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to provide context so that the  information within the table can be conveyed in a meaningful way. </p>
<div style="background-color:#FFC; border:gray solid 1px; padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.5em;">
<p><h3>Tips for tables</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Only use tables for tabular information,       not for formatting.</li>
<li>Use &ldquo;real tables&rdquo; rather than text       formatted to look like tables using the TAB key or space bar. These will       not be recognized by assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged       cells and dividing complex data sets into separate smaller tables, where       possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the       header to show at the top of each page. Also set the table to break       between rows instead of in the middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text  summary of the essential table contents. Any abbreviations used should be  explained in the summary. </li>
<li>Table       captions or descriptions should answer the question &quot;what is the       table's purpose and how is it organized?&quot; (e.g., &quot;A sample order       form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity&quot;). </li>
<li>Table       cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as labels to help       interpret the other cells in the table. </li>
<li>Table       header cells labels should be concise and clear. </li>
<li>Ensure       the table is not &ldquo;floating&rdquo; on the page (see <a href="presentationsx5.html#_Toc284333453">Technique 4</a>). </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Data Chart</strong> </li>
<li>Click a location on the slide to  insert the table</li>
<li>In the <strong>Data Chart Gallery</strong> dialog, select <strong>Table</strong> from the <strong>Chart type</strong> list</li>
<li>Select a table style from the  icons in the center of the <strong>Data  Chart Gallery</strong> dialog</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK
<p>
      <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/PresentationsX5_8.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of Table option and Data Chart Gallery in Data Chart Gallery dialog." width="401" height="197" /></p>
<p>  </p></strong> </li>

<li>In the Datasheet dialog,  double-click the cells in the first row</li>
<li>In the Edit Current Cell dialog,  enter your heading into the Data text box</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
<li>Close the Datasheet dialog after  updating it with data for your table</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When  you create lists, it is important to format them as &ldquo;real lists&rdquo;. Otherwise,  assistive technologies will interpret your list as a series of short separate  paragraphs instead of a coherent list of related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text box  or highlight the text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Bulleted List Properties&hellip;</strong><br />
  Note: If the text box is a <strong>Title</strong> or<strong> Subtitle</strong>box, go to menu item: <strong>Format  &gt; Title Properties&hellip; or Format  &gt; Subtitle properties&hellip;</strong>  </li>
<li>In the <strong>Bulleted List</strong> dialog,  select the appropriate tabs and make your adjustments<br />
    Note: Avoid applying bullet animation by  avoiding the <strong>Bullet  Animation</strong> tab (see <a href="presentationsx5.html#tech9.5">Technique 9.5</a>).
<p>
    <img src="sites/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/files/PresentationsX5_9.png" alt="Image demonstrates location of tabs in Bullet List Properties dialog." width="332" height="247" />
    </p>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> to  apply to that text box, or select <strong>Apply  to All</strong> to apply these list properties  to all text objects in the presentation</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing  text in columns. <br />
    <em>Note:</em> Because  columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive technologies, consider  whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Document Title</h3>
<p>In  case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given a descriptive  and meaningful title. </p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document </h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In the <strong>Title</strong> box,  type a descriptive name for the document<br />
  <em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated  to the template name, discussed above. </li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc278376940" id="_Toc278376940">Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</a> </h2>
<p> Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the information. </p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select  a slide layout with a placeholder for a data chart (see <a href="presentationsx5.html#tech3.1">Technique 3.1</a>)</li>
<li>Double-click*  to the center of the placeholder to add a data chart</li>
<li>In the <strong>Data Chart Gallery</strong>,  select a <strong>Chart  type</strong> and style</li>

<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts,  use the formatting options to create different types of dotted lines to  facilitate legibility for users who are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it  is helpful to apply texture instead of color to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors  to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options  to change predefined colors, ensuring that they align with sufficient contrast  requirements (see <a href="presentationsx5.html#tech9.2">Technique 9.2</a>) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc284508121" id="_Toc284508121">Technique 9. Make  Content Easier to See</a> </h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When  formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed, try to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for       body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than       bold or light weight fonts. If you       do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them sparingly. </li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing       and easily recognized upper and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts       (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts       (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in       caps, italic or underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character       spacing, rather than condensed spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can&rsquo;t users just  zoom in?</strong>Office applications do typically include  accessibility features such as the ability to magnify documents and support for  high contrast modes. However, because printing is an important aspect of many  workflows and changing font sizes directly will change documents details such  the pagination, the layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to always  format text for a reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><a name="tech9.2"></a>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The  visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ration of  at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a  white background:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black,       Background=white, Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast       (Foreground=#767676, Background=white, Ratio=4.54:1) </li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast       (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white, Ratio=2.32:1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Also,  always use a single solid color for a text background rather than a pattern.<br />
  In  order to determine whether the colors in your document have sufficient  contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast  Ratio Analyzer</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone </h3>
<p>Color  should not be used as the only visual means of conveying information,  indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual  element. In order to spot where color  might be the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a  screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale converting  tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graybit.com/main.php">GrayBit  v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on  Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The  instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely  solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or shape of content  elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing       the color of text you have edited and noting the color. Instead use PowerPoint       2010&rsquo;s &ldquo;Track Changes&rdquo; feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by       referring to their appearance (e.g. &ldquo;the bigger one&rdquo;). Instead, label each       image with a figure number and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="tech9.5"></a>9.5 Avoid Using Images of  Text</h3>
<p>Before  you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to ensure a certain  font or color combination), consider whether you can achieve the same result by  styling &ldquo;real text&rdquo;. If this is not possible, as with logos containing stylized  text, make sure to provide alternative text for the image following the  techniques noted above.</p>
<h3>9.6 Avoid  Transitions </h3>
<p>Transitions  between slides and elements in each slide (e.g., bullets in a list flying onto  the screen) can be distracting to users with disabilities. It can also cause assistive technologies to  read the slide incorrectly. For these  reasons, it is best to avoid transitions altogether.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc284508122" id="_Toc284508122">Technique 10.  Make Content Easier to Understand</a> </h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in  a consistent way, it will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all  users:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Whenever possible, write       clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and       spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document       too &ldquo;busy&rdquo; by using lots of whitespace and by avoiding too many different       colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on       multiple pages within a document or within a set of documents (e.g.,       headings, footings, etc.), it should occur consistently each time it is       repeated. </li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>At this time, Presentations X5 does not  provide a mechanism for inserting hyperlinks or editing their text. <strong>[Tested September 16th, 2010]</strong> </p>
<p>Hyperlinks  are more effective navigation aids when the user understands the likely result  of following the link. Otherwise, users may have to use trial-and-error to find  what they need.</p>
<p>To  help the user understand the result of selecting a hyperlink, ensure that the  link makes sense when read in the context of the text around it. For example,  while it would be confusing to use &ldquo;more information&rdquo; as a link by itself on a  page, it would be fine to use &ldquo;more information&rdquo; as a link in the following  sentence: &ldquo;The airport can be reached by taxi or bus (<u>more information</u>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  make the address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the  address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h3>10.3 Accessible  Presentations </h3>
<p>It is  important to consider accessibility before, during, and after presentations. Below is a helpful link with  guidance on how to make presentations accessible to all:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc284333460" id="_Toc284333460">Technique 11. Check Accessibility</a> </h2>
<p>At this time, Presentations X5  does not offer a mechanism for accessibility checking to identify potential  accessibility errors prior to publishing. <strong>[Tested: September 20th, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the  accessibility of your document or template (see <a href="presentationsx5.html#_Toc284508113">Technique 1</a>), then you may  consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an accessibility  check in one of those formats, as described below. </p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of  your document or template (see <a href="presentationsx5.html#_Toc284508113">Technique 1</a>), one option is to save it  into HTML format and use one of the web accessibility checkers available  online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility  Evaluation Tool </a><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF  format, you can use the following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility  of the PDF document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Acrobat  Professional</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pac-pdf-accessibility-checker.html">PDF Accessibility Checker (PAC) </a> &ndash;  a free alternative provided by &ldquo;Access for all&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go  to menu item: <strong>Advanced  &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full Check&hellip;</strong> </li>
<li>In  the <strong>Full  Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking option</li>
