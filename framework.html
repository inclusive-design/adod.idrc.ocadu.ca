<p>The ADOD Assessment Framework applies  specifically to <strong><em>office documents</em></strong>, which are defined as computer  documents that are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by  people </strong>(i.e., not computer code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable </strong>(i.e., where dynamic features are limited to automatic page  numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not include audio, video, or embedded  interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other resources unlike web content),  and </li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style  workflows </strong>(Reports, letters, memos, budgets,  presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>The ADOD Assessment Framework does not  simply apply to any document produced by an office application using an office  document format. This is an important distinction because office document formats  and office applications have been extended over the years to allow the creation  of content with many of the same dynamic and interactive features as <strong><em>web  content technologies</em></strong> offer (e.g., hyperlinking to other resources,  multimedia support, and programmability). <strong>When office document formats are  used to create dynamic and/or interactive content (whether or not for the Web),  WCAG 2.0 rather than the ADOD Assessment Framework should be consulted to  assess accessibility.</strong><br />
  Since full inclusion includes allowing  everyone to be both consumers and producers of content, the ADOD Assessment  Framework addresses the question of office document accessibility from several  perspectives:</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility of office documents </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1  ([ADOD-Office-Documents] Assessing the accessibility of office documents)</strong> addresses the accessibility of complete office documents, ready for  sharing with other users. This section is based on WCAG 2.0.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessibility of Office  Document Formats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 2  ([ADOD-Office-Formats] Assessing the accessibility of office document formats)</strong> addresses the accessibility of the underlying office document  formats, regardless of how they are presented to users in the various office  applications. This section is based on a subset of [ADOD-Office-Documents], above.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessibility of Office Application  User Interfaces </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 3  ([ADOD-Office-Applications-UI] Assessing the accessibility of office  application user interfaces)</strong> addresses the  accessibility to users with disabilities of the user interfaces provided by  office applications. This section is based on ATAG 1.0 Guideline 7 (&ldquo;Ensure  that the authoring tool is accessible to authors with disabilities.&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support for Authoring Accessible  Office Documents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 4  ([ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports] Assessing the provision by office  applications of support for authoring accessible office documents)</strong> addresses the features that office applications provide to all  users to support and encourage production of accessible office documents. This  section is based on ATAG 1.0 Guidelines 1-6.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note re: Presentations:</em> Of the three types of office documents, presentations are the most  likely to make use of dynamic or interactive content (e.g., audio, video,  multimedia, animations, hyperlinks to other resources, etc.). When this is the  case, WCAG 2.0 should be used to assess accessibility, rather than ADOD&rsquo;s  Assessment Framework.</p>
<p><em>Note re: Document editing is not  considered &ldquo;dynamic/interactive&rdquo; content:</em> One of  the typical features of office documents is that they are often editable and  during editing, a certain amount of interactivity and dynamism may occur (e.g.,  the document updates to reflect the user&rsquo;s last entry, when the use updates a  spreadsheet cell other cells may also update). <strong>However, the ADOD Assessment  Framework does not consider changes caused by editing an office document to  constitute interactive/dynamic content.</strong> </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc280180409" id="_Toc280180409"></a><a name="_Toc280180258" id="_Toc280180258">Relationship between ADOD and WCAG 2.0/ATAG 1.0</a></h2>
<p><strong>The W3C-WAI Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) and W3C-WAI Authoring Tool Accessibility  Guidelines (ATAG 1.0*) provide open, comprehensive and respected guidance on  how to develop accessible web content and accessible web content authoring tools.</strong> <strong>The ADOD Assessment Framework is an attempt to usefully apply  these guidelines to the context of office documents/application with as little &ldquo;adjustment&rdquo;  as possible. </strong></p>
<p>The adjustments are necessary  because simply applying WCAG 2.0 and ATAG 1.0 to  the context of office documents/applications has several drawbacks: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vocabulary confusion:</strong> ATAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 both make frequent use of terms such as &ldquo;web  content&rdquo; and &ldquo;authoring tool&rdquo; that need to be re-mapped to be applicable to  office documents and office applications. Creating adjusted sets of success  criteria for the ADOD Assessment Framework allowed the office document-specific  terms to be inserted </li>
<li><strong>Numerous non-applicable success criteria: </strong>Because ADOD focuses specifically on office documents without dynamic  or interactive content, many WCAG 2.0 success criteria are not applicable.  Creating an adjusted set of office document accessibility success criteria for the  ADOD Assessment Framework allowed the non-applicable success criteria to be  dropped. </li>
<li><strong>Multiple conformance levels: </strong>In  formulating an easy-to-use assessment framework for office documents it was  judged that the multiple conformance levels were an unnecessary complication.  Creating adjusted sets of success criteria for the ADOD Assessment Framework at  WCAG 2.0 Level AA meant that the level identifiers could be removed.</li>
<li><strong>ATAG 1.0 references WCAG 1.0: </strong>ATAG 1.0 references WCAG 1.0, rather than the  current W#C Recommendation, WCAG 2.0. Creating adjusted  sets of success criteria for the ADOD Assessment Framework meant that the references  could be changed to WCAG 2.0.</li>
<li><strong>ATAG 1.0 is prioritized differently that WCAG 2.0: </strong>In WCAG 2.0, &ldquo;success criteria&rdquo;  are assigned a &ldquo;Level&rdquo; between Level A and Level AA. In ATAG 1.0, &ldquo;checkpoints&rdquo;  are assigned a &ldquo;Priority&rdquo; between priority 1 and priority 3. &ldquo;Relative  Priority&rdquo; items take their priority level from the WCAG content in question. Creating adjusted sets of success criteria for the ADOD Assessment  Framework meant that common wording could be employed.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, in order to reduce the  risk of &ldquo;fragmenting&rdquo; the guidance provided to office application developers,  who have only a limited budget for maintaining and improving of accessibility  features, the ADOD Assessment Framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uses the W3C-WAI numbering  schemes</strong> and </li>
<li><strong>Uses the original W3C-WAI  wording except where vocabulary adjustments are indentified with square  brackets</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>* At  the time of writing, ATAG 1.0 is the current Recommendation of W3C; ATAG 2.0 is  under development.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc280180410" id="_Toc280180410"></a><a name="_Toc280180259" id="_Toc280180259">Conformance</a></h2>
<p>Since the ADOD Assessment Framework is  essentially a &ldquo;view&rdquo; of WCAG 2.0 and ATAG 1.0 that is specific to office  documents and office applications, an ADOD-specific conformance model is  unnecessary. Instead, official conformance claims should be made to WCAG 2.0  (for office documents) and ATAG 1.0 (for office applications), noting that any  Web-specific wording has been interpreted for an office document/application  context. </p>
<p>If the document or application meets the  criteria for being an office document or office application under the ADOD  definition (i.e., used by people, text-based, fully printable, self-contained,  and is typical of office-style workflows) then &ldquo;Not Applicable&rdquo; can be entered  for all of the WCAG 2.0/ATAG 1.0 success criteria that are left out of the ADOD  Assessment Framework.</p>

<p>These success criteria relate to assessing  the accessibility of office documents to users with disabilities. They are  based largely on WCAG 2.0 up to Level AA (see &ldquo;Relationship between ADOD and  WCAG 2.0/ATAG 1.0&rdquo; for more information).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note: This part of the  framework does not cover office documents that contain dynamic or interactive  content (e.g., audio, video, multimedia, animations, hyperlinks to other  resources, forms, etc.). In these cases, refer instead to WCAG 2.0.</strong></li>
<li>See Appendix A for:
<ul>
<li>The original WCAG 2.0 success  criteria wording (certain Web-specific terms and references have been adjusted  to apply to office documents and applications). In [ADOD-Office-Documents] the  adjusted terms or references are marked with &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo;.</li>

</li>
<li>For clarity, the WCAG 2.0 numbering  scheme has been maintained with the added prefix &ldquo;[ADOD-Office-Documents]&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents  1.1.1] Non-text Content:</strong> All non-text content that is presented to  the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for  the situations listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test: </strong>If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if  presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive  identification of the non-text content. </li>
<li><strong>Sensory: </strong>If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory  experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification  of the non-text content. </li>
<li><strong>Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: </strong>If non-text  content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not  presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by  assistive technology. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 1.3.1] Info and Relationships:</strong> Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be  programmatically determined or are available in text.</p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 1.3.2] Meaningful Sequence:</strong> When the  sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading  sequence can be programmatically determined.</p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 1.3.3] Sensory Characteristics:</strong> Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely  solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual  location, orientation, or sound. <em>Note: </em>For  requirements related to color, refer to Guideline 1.4.</p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 1.4.1] Use of Color:</strong> Color is  not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an  action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. <em>Note: </em>This success criterion addresses color perception specifically.  Other forms of perception are covered in Guideline 1.3 including programmatic  access to color and other visual presentation coding.</p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents  1.4.3] Contrast (Minimum):</strong> The visual presentation of text and images  of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large Text: </strong>Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio  of at least 3:1;</li>
<li><strong>Incidental: </strong>Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface  component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that  are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no  contrast requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Logotypes: </strong>Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast  requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents  1.4.5] Images of Text:</strong> If the technologies being used can achieve  the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images  of text except for the following: <em>Note: </em>Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or  brand name) are considered essential.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customizable:</strong> The image of text can be visually customized to the user's  requirements;</li>
<li><strong>Essential:</strong> A particular presentation of text is essential to the information  being conveyed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 2.4.1] Bypass Blocks: A mechanism  is available to bypass blocks of content [in office documents]. </strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 2.4.2] Page Titled: [Office  documents] have titles that describe topic or purpose. </strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 2.4.3] Focus Order: If [an  office document] can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences  affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order  that preserves meaning and operability. </strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 2.4.4] Link Purpose (In Context): The purpose  of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text  together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the  purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general. </strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 2.4.6] Headings and Labels: Headings  and labels describe topic or purpose. </strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 3.1.1] Language of Page: The default  human language of each [office document] can be programmatically determined. </strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 3.1.2] Language of Parts: The human  language of each passage or phrase in the content can be programmatically  determined except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate  language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the  immediately surrounding text. </strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 3.2.4] Consistent Identification: Components  that have the same functionality within a set of [office documents] are  identified consistently.</strong></p>

<p>These success criteria relate to assessing  the intrinsic accessibility supports provided by office document formats (<strong>not </strong>the accessibility of actual office documents created by authors - for this,  see Part 1, above). <br />
  Essentially, each [ADOD-Office-Formats]  success criterion refers to the office formats ability to support any  functionality pre-supposed by the [ADOD-Office-Documents] success criterion of  the same number. For example, &ldquo;[ADOD-Office-Formats 1.1.1] The office format  provides mechanism(s) for short and long text alternatives for non-text content  and the ability to indicate that non-text content should be ignored by  assistive technology.&rdquo; tests the ability of the format to be used to create  office documents that meet &ldquo;[ADOD-Office-Documents 1.1.1] Non-text Content: All  non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
  <strong>Note: This part of the framework does  not cover the use of office formats to create office documents that contain  dynamic or interactive content (e.g., audio, video, multimedia, animations,  hyperlinks to other resources, forms, etc.).</strong></p>

<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  1.1] Ensure that the author can produce accessible [office document] content in  the [office formats] supported by the [office application].</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  1.2] Ensure that the [office application] preserves all accessibility  information during authoring, transformations, and conversions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  1.3] Ensure that when the [office application] automatically generates  [content] it conforms to [ADOD-Office-Documents].</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  1.4] Ensure that templates provided by the [office application] conform to the  [ADOD-Office-Documents].</strong><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  2.2] Ensure that the [office application] automatically generates valid [office  documents].</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  3.1] Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information (e.g.,  captions, auditory descriptions, and collated text transcripts for video).</strong><br />
  <strong>Note:  Some checkpoints in the [ADOD-Office-Documents] may not apply.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  3.2] Help the author create structured content and separate information from  its presentation.</strong><br />
  <strong>Note:  Some checkpoints in [ADOD-Office-Documents] may not apply.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  3.3] Ensure that prepackaged [office document] content conforms to the  [ADOD-Office-Documents].</strong><br />
  <strong>For  example, include captions, an auditory description, and a collated text  transcript with prepackaged movies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  3.4] Do not automatically generate equivalent alternatives. Do not reuse  previously authored alternatives without author confirmation, except when the  function is known with certainty.</strong><br />
  <strong>For  example, prompt the author for a text equivalent of an image. If the author has  already provided a text equivalent for the same image used in another document,  offer to reuse that text and prompt the author for confirmation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  4.1] Check for and inform the author of accessibility problems.</strong><br />
  <strong>Note:  Accessibility problems should be detected automatically where possible. Where  this is not possible, the [office application] may need to prompt the author to  make decisions or to manually check for certain types of problems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  4.2] Assist authors in correcting accessibility problems.</strong><br />
  <strong>At  a minimum, provide context-sensitive help with the accessibility checking  required by checkpoint 4.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports 5.1] Ensure  that functionality related to accessible authoring practices is naturally  integrated into the overall look and feel of the [office application].</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  5.2] Ensure that accessible authoring practices supporting  [ADOD-Office-Documents] checkpoints are among the most obvious and easily  initiated by the author.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  A] Document all features that promote the production of accessible [office  documents].</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports  B] Ensure that creating accessible [office documents] is a naturally integrated  part of the documentation, including examples.</strong></p>

<p>Terms specific to WCAG 2.0 and ATAG 1.0 are  defined in those Recommendations.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>office documents (digital office  documents)</strong></dt>
<dd>Computer files encoded in <strong>office document formats </strong>that are:
<ul>
<li>Intended to be used by people  (i.e., are not computer code),</li>
<li>Text-based (i.e., are not  simply images, although they may contain images),</li>
<li>Fully printable (i.e., dynamic  features are limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. not  audio, video, and embedded interactivity),</li>
<li>Self-contained (i.e., without  links to other resources as is common with web content), and </li>
<li>Typical of office-style  workflows (Reports, letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>    <em>Note:</em> This  purposefully excludes most documents making use of dynamic and interactive  content (audio, video, hyperlinks to other resources, forms, programmability,  etc.), since the accessibility of these are better assessed using WCAG 2.0.  ADOD does, however, cover some dynamic content (animations, audio and video) in  the context of presentations. </p></dd>
<dt><strong>office document formats (digital office  document formats)</strong></dt>
<dd>Computer file formats that are produced and viewed  primarily by <strong>office applications</strong>, such as word processor formats (e.g.,  Microsoft Word (*.doc, *.docx), OpenDocument Text (*.odt)), spreadsheet formats  (Microsoft Excel (*.xls, *.xlsx) and OpenDocument Spreadsheet (*.ods)), and  presentation formats (e.g., Microsoft Powerpoint (*.ppt, *.pptx) and OpenDocument Presentation (*.odp)).</dd>
<dt><strong>office applications (digital office  applications)</strong></dt>
<dd>Computer programs that are used to create <strong>office  documents</strong>. Office applications are available for desktop platforms,  mobile devices, web-based etc.</dd>
<dt><strong>office application suite</strong></dt>
<dd>A set of <strong>office applications</strong> that are  distributed together. The applications that make up a suite often share  relatively consistent user interfaces and the ability for enhanced interaction  between them (e.g., the ability to paste a spreadsheet directly into a word processing  document). ADOD covers the typical core members of most office suites: word  processors, spreadsheet applications, and presentation applications. In  addition, some suites include note-takers, flow-chart editors, image editors,  formula editors, etc.</dd>

<h3><a name="_Toc280180421" id="_Toc280180421"></a><a name="_Toc280180270" id="_Toc280180270">Appendix A: Rationale for inclusion of success  criteria in &ldquo;Part 1: [ADOD-Office-Documents] Assessing the accessibility of office  documents&rdquo;</a></h3>
<p>These success criteria relate to assessing  the accessibility of office documents to users with disabilities.<br />
  &nbsp;<strong>WCAG  2.0 (Level A and Level AA Success Criteria) has been used as a basis for [ADOD-Office-Documents] </strong>(see &ldquo;Relationship between ADOD and WCAG 2.0/ATAG 2.0&rdquo;), with the following  exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some terminology and references need to be interpreted differently:
<ul>
<li><strong>* Web-specific terms.</strong> These should be  interpreted in the context of office documents and office applications (see &ldquo;Relationship  between ADOD and WCAG 2.0/ATAG 2.0&rdquo;)
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&ldquo;web page(s)&rdquo; is to be interpreted as &ldquo;office  document(s)&rdquo;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&ldquo;(web) content&rdquo; is to be interpreted as  &ldquo;(office document) content&rdquo;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&ldquo;web content technology&rdquo; is to be interpreted  as &ldquo;office document format&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some success criteria are not applicable. The reasons for this  include:
<ul>
<li><em>(interactive/dynamic)</em>: The success  criterion refers to a level of interactivity or dynamism (e.g., &ldquo;live audio&rdquo;)  exceeding that typically found in word processor, spreadsheet or presentation documents.</li>
<li><em>(application responsibility)</em>: The  success criterion is typically handled by the viewing functionality of office  applications (e.g., focus indicator, parsing, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some Level A success criteria are superseded by other level AA  success criteria.
<ul>
<li><strong>[WCAG 2.0 2.4.1] Bypass  Blocks: A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated  on multiple Web pages*. (Level A)</strong> is adjusted  somewhat more than the other requirements. Instead of simply switching the  vocabulary, the requirement is changed to refer to bypassing blocks of content  within a document, not just when the block appear on multiple documents (i.e., &ldquo;<strong>[ADOD-Office-Documents 2.4.1] Bypass  Blocks: A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content [in office  documents].</strong>&rdquo;) The reason for this is that office documents are typically  more self-contained than Web documents and provide more built-in navigation  mechanisms (e.g., table of contents, page numbering).</li>

<li><strong>Controls, Input: </strong>If    non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that    describes its purpose. (Refer to Guideline 4.1 for additional requirements    for controls and content that accepts user input.) </li>
<li><strong>Time-Based Media: </strong>If    non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide    descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2    for additional requirements for media.) </li>
<li><strong>Test: </strong>If non-text content* is a test or exercise that    would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least    provide descriptive identification of the non-text content*. </li>
<li><strong>Sensory: </strong>If non-text content* is primarily intended to    create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide    descriptive identification of the non-text content*. </li>
<li><strong>CAPTCHA: </strong>If the purpose of non-text    content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than    a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of    the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using    output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to    accommodate different disabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: </strong>If non-text content* is    pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to    users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive    technology.</li>

<p>These guidelines relate to determining the  degree to which all users are supported by office applications in the production  of accessible office documents.<br />
    <strong>ATAG 1.0 Guidelines 1-6 (Priority 1 and  2 Checkpoints) has been used as a basis for [ADOD-Office-Applications-Supports]</strong> (see &ldquo;Relationship between ADOD and WCAG 2.0/ATAG 1.0&rdquo;), with the  following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some terminology and references need to be interpreted differently  as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>* Web-specific terms.</strong> These should be  interpreted in the context of office documents and office applications (see  &ldquo;Relationship between ADOD and WCAG 2.0/ATAG 2.0&rdquo;)
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;web page(s)&rdquo; is to be  interpreted as &ldquo;office document(s)&rdquo;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&ldquo;(web) content&rdquo; is to be interpreted as  &ldquo;(office document) content&rdquo;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&ldquo;markup languages&rdquo; is to be interpreted as  &ldquo;office document formats&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;authoring tool&rdquo; is to be  interpreted as &ldquo;office application&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&dagger; References to WCAG 1.0.</strong> These should  be interpreted as references to [ADOD-Office-Documents] (Part 2).</li>
<li><strong>&Dagger; References to ATAG 2.0 Part A.</strong> These  should be interpreted as references to [ADOD-Office-Applications-UI] (Part 3).</li>
<li>Some success criteria are not applicable. The reasons for this  include:
<ul>
<li><em>(office applications are typically also the viewers)</em>: The success criterion is not relevant because office applications  are typically both the authoring and (pre)viewing applications for office  documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>During the Public Review, the issue of  harmonization with the U.S. Section 508 Regulations (Electronic and Information  Technology) was raised. While the ADOD Assessment Framework is based on WCAG  2.0/ATAG 1.0, it is useful to consider how they compare with Section 508.</p>

<p>This part of the ADOD Assessment Framework  is based on WCAG 2.0 and is most similar to &ldquo;1194.22 Web-based Intranet and  Internet Information and Applications&rdquo; of the Section 508 Regulations (2001).&nbsp; The table below identifies how ADOD requirements  compare with the Section 508 criteria. <strong>Note: The Section 508 Regulations  are currently being updated and there are indications that the new regulations  will be more closely harmonized with WCAG 2.0 and therefore with this Part of  the ADOD Assessment Framework.</strong></p>

<p>This part of the ADOD Assessment Framework  is based on ATAG 1.0 and is most similar to &ldquo;1194.21 Software Applications and  Operating Systems&rdquo; of the Section 508 Regulations (2001). This part of ADOD  begins with the general requirement to &ldquo;[u]se all applicable operating system  and accessibility standards and conventions that are important or essential to  accessibility&hellip;&rdquo;.
